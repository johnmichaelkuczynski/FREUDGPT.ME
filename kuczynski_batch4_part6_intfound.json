    "text": "The purpose of this paper is to show that a doctrine known as intentionalism is guilty of what Wilfred Sellars called ‘the myth of the given’, and is therefore untenable. What is intentionalism? Some mental entities have both phenomenal content (phenomenology) and representational content. My perception represents the world as being a certain way; so it has representational content. And there is ‘something it is like’ to have that perception; so it has phenomenal content (it has ‘phenomenology’). Intentionalism says that two experiences cannot have different phenomenal contents unless they have different representational contents. So phenomenal content ‘supervenes’ on representational content. I submit that intentionalism is guilty of the ‘myth of the given’. Let me say what this means by way of a Sellarsian story. You are in a tie shop in which the lighting conditions are a bit unusual. You are looking at a tie in a display case. The tie induces various visual sensations in you. On the basis of these sensations, you can’t quite tell whether the tie is orange or red or maroon. You take the tie outside to examine it in better lighting. You see that it is maroon. Now you know what a maroon tie looks like under the lighting conditions that obtain in the tie shop. So the next time you see what is in fact a maroon tie in the tie shop, you don’t have to take it outside to determine that it is maroon. But if a tie is some color other than maroon– say, burgundy or maroon -- you cannot know that on the basis of the visual sensations you have in the tie shop – for the same reason that, earlier, you couldn’t tell that a tie was maroon on the basis of the sensations you had in the tie shop. Let me illustrate my meaning with a new story. You are again in the tie shop, and are looking at what is in fact a burgundy tie. You can’t tell what color it is. So you take it outside. There you see that it is burgundy. You take it back inside and attend to its appearance. You then know that that is what a burgundy neck-tie looks like in the conditions that obtain in the tie shop. You repeat this process over and over again, until you can tell for any color C what an object with C...",

    "text": "At first this seems like a reasonable view. But really it is very arbitrary. As Tyler Burge said, a perception to the effect that P is necessarily prima facie evidence that P. If you see a red chair in front of you, that is necessarily prima facie evidence that there is a red chair in front of you. In the story we are telling, you wake up every morning with goggles of a different level of magnification attached to your eyes, and you never wake knowing what the level of magnification is. Under those circumstances, your initial sensations are not even prima facie evidence of facts relating to the sizes or distances of objects. Given only your initial sensations, you would be equally justified in believing that you were seeing 100 ft object 100 ft away or a ten thousand foot object 10,000 feet away. So your initial sensations wouldn’t be prima facie evidence of either state of affairs – or, by analogous reasoning, of any other state of affairs relating to the distance or size of the object in question. Thus your initial perceptions wouldn’t tell you that the object was this as opposed to that size or distance; you wouldn’t, veridically or non-veridically, see the object as being of this or that size or distance. The objector’s point can be confuted in another way. Again, suppose you wake up wearing goggles that strengthen your vision four-fold, but when you wake up you don’t know what magnification these goggles have. After you ‘acclimatize’ to your goggles, you will simply see objects as having the dimensions that they in fact. (We are leaving aside cases of objects that are extremely distance or extremely small. One doesn’t really see a star to a million light years away; one doesn’t see it, veridically or non-veridically, to be any determinate distance away from one. And of course one doesn’t see a proton, veridically or non-veridically, to have this or that size; for one doesn’t see protons at all.) After this acclimatization, when you look at an object that is ten ft tall and twenty ft away, you won’t first see it as forty ft tall and eighty ft away; you will see it for the size and distance that it actually has – just as the veteran of the tie-shop, even while in the tie-shop, will see ties for the colors they actually...",

    "text": "But this doesn’t apply to Bob. Depending on whether he is in his ×1 phase or his ×10 phase, a given a bit of phenomenal content may mediate perceptions with very different representational contents. So there is sameness of phenomenal content and a difference in representational content. The same bit of phenomenal content is deployed once in seeing a small nearby tree, and another time in seeing distant large tree. These considerations help us identify the shortcoming in a well known argument for intentionalism due to (or at least stated by) Alex Byrne. Byrne gives the following argument for intentionalism. Suppose you are looking at a blue chip. Your seeing the blue of the chip obviously involves your having some kind of phenomenal content. Now imagine a change in the phenomenal content that is involved in your seeing the blue of the chip. If there is such a change, then there is necessarily a change in the color that the chip is represented to as having; it goes from being represented as blue to being represented as (say) green. The same point (mutatis mutandis) applies to any perception. If you imagine a change in the phenomenal character of your gustatory perception of the honey, then the honey goes from being represented as sweet to being represented as (say) bitter. One last example: suppose you hear a certain pitch as a middle C (you have perfect pitch); if the phenomenal content involved in your hearing that pitch is changed, then ipso facto you no longer hear that sound as a middle C but as (say) a middle D. So: no difference in phenomenal content without a different in representational content.",

    "text": "But there are obvious counter-examples to this. You can feel the roundness of the ball and also see it (a bat could hear it, a mole could smell it). But these perceptions have no phenomenal overlap, despite considerable (though my no means total) representational overlap. You can see distances, and you can also learn distances kinesthetically. Obviously a visual perception has no phenomenal overlap with a series of kinesthetic sensations, despite a certain overlap in representational content. Also non-occurrent memories have no phenomenal overlap with perceptions whose representations they store (or can store, in principle) in their entirety. Total overlap of representational content: no phenomenal overlap. (Of course intentionalism is defined as the position that two experiences cannot differ in phenomenal content without differing in representational content. So it may see that intentionalism doesn’t say anything about whether a non-occurrent memory can have the same representational content as, say, a perception without having any phenomenal overlap with it. But this is not the case. Consider a perception P with phenomenal content C and representational content R. Intentionalism says that having P has C wholly in virtue of having R. So, for intentionalism, having R is a sufficient condition for having P. So, if intentionalism, then nothing other than having R is needed to have C. So intentionalism is committed to the view that anything has P as long as it has R. But a non-occurrent memory has R but not P.) Byrne’s argument proves at most that within a single sensory modality there cannot be phenomenal variation without representational variation. But this thesis is false, it turns out, if we consider different sensory modalities or memories. But we’ve seen that Byrne’s thesis is false even within a single modality. At the same time, it is not an accidental fact, surely, that within a single modality, differences in phenomenal content tend to co-vary with differences in representational content. And, admittedly, the most obvious way to explain this is by advocating some kind of intentionalism. So we owe Byrne an non-intentionalist explanation of this co-variation. What Byrne has shown is not that phenomenal content co-varies tout court with representational content, but that phenomenal content co-varies with representational content all other things being equal. And I submit that, in this case, the ‘other things’ consist of one’s background knowledge. Obviously phenomenal content is involved, in an essential way, in our perceptions; and, obviously,...",
