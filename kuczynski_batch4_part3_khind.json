    "text": "§ Let us begin with some points about terminology. The word “concept” has two meanings – one logical, one psychological. Consider the sentence “Little Timmy doesn’t have a concept of an irrational number.” In this sentence, the word “concept” refers to a certain kind of psychological entity. Now consider the sentence “for any x, if x falls under the concept triangle, then x falls under the concept closed figure.” In this sentence, the word “concept” obviously does not refer to a mental entity of any kind, but rather to some kind of non-psychological, presumably platonic, entity. In this paper, I will typically use the word “concept” in its non-psychological sense; and when I describe a proposition as “conceptually necessary”, I mean that it holds entirely in virtue of facts about concepts in the non-psychological sense of the word. Consider the proposition triangles have three sides. It is clear that the truth of that proposition has nothing to do with psychology, since it would be true in a world devoid of sentient beings. Further, its truth is guaranteed by the structures of the concepts composing it – the concepts triangle, three, and so forth – and is thus not contingent on anything that could possibly fail to be the case. The proposition triangles have three sides is therefore “conceptually necessary”, as I will be using this expression. Sometimes I will use the expression “conceptually true” as a synonym for “conceptually necessary.” As we will see, Kant recognizes a different category of necessary truth. In his view, some propositions are necessarily true in virtue of facts about our minds. When I wish to discuss that kind of necessity, I will use the term “representational necessity.”",

    "text": "II. Now we must say just what is meant by the terms “synthetic” and “a priori” and, therefore, what is meant by the conjugate terms “analytic” and “a posteriori.” If a proposition is known to be true in some way other than through empirical work, Kant describes it as “a priori.” Consider the proposition 1+1=2. To know that is it true, one doesn’t do empirical work; one doesn’t perform experiments or make observations. 1+1=2 is thus a priori. For Kant, a priority is a property of our knowledge of propositions. Of course, Kant does describe propositions themselves as “a priori.” But when Kant does so, he is really making a statement about our knowledge of those propositions. For Kant, a proposition is a priori not in virtue of its intrinsic or strictly logical properties, but in virtue of facts about how one comes to know it. A consequence of this conception of a priority – one that Kant himself draws -- is that a given proposition could, in principle, be a priori for one creature and a posteriori for another. As we will see, it is an essential fact about Kant’s system that, in it, the concept of a priority is understood in psychological (or epistemological), and thus not in strictly logical, terms. For Kant, a proposition is “a posteriori” if it is not a priori. Consider the proposition Smith weighs over 200 lbs. To know that is true, one must do empirical work. So it is not a priori, and is therefore a posteriori. Now let us turn to the expressions “analytic” and “synthetic.” Here we must be careful. These days the term “analytic” is often used to describe sentences. A sentence is “analytic” exactly if its semantics guarantees its truth. So “triangles have three sides” is analytic because, given what it means, it must be true. But this is not how Kant was using that term. Kant uses the term “analytic” to describe propositions – not sentences, and not our knowledge of anything. Kant’s official definition of “analytic” is this: a proposition is analytic if “nothing is contained in the predicate which is not contained in the subject.” So all tall males are males is analytic because nothing is “contained” in the predicate (“males”) which is not “contained” in the subject (“all tall males”). A proposition is “synthetic” if it is not analytic. As Quine pointed out, there...",

    "text": "§ Let us now look more closely at Kant’s reasons for regarding these propositions as synthetic, i.e. as not being conceptually true. Kant begins by saying that, when you think 7+5, you don’t necessarily think =12. Kant is right about this. When you think m+n, you don’t necessarily think the sum of that operation. That is why we need calculators. But at this point, Kant’s reasoning becomes fuzzy. The fuzziness is due to the fact that Kant is not clear, either in his thinking or in his exposition, about whether he is using the term “concept” in the logical, or the psychological sense; he goes back and forth. It does not appear that he registered this distinction. But I think it is fair to reconstruct his reasoning as follows. Given that you don’t think =12 when you think 7+5, it seems to follow that your concept (i.e. your grasp) of 7+5 doesn’t contain or include your concept =12. So in exercising your grasp of the concept 7+5, you are not exercising your grasp of the concept =12. Therefore your grasp of the concept =12 is altogether distinct from your grasp of the concept 7+5. When you think straight line, you don’t necessarily think shortest distance between two points. What you think, says Kant, is purely qualitative, not quantitative; you think of a line with a certain shape, not a line of a certain distance. So your grasp of the concept straight-line is distinct from your grasp of the concept distance. From this Kant apparently infers that the concept 7+5 is entirely distinct from the concept =12. But this inference involves a muddle of the two meanings of the word “concept”. My concept of 7+5 is distinct from my concept of =12. But, by itself, this doesn’t show that the concept 7+5 is distinct from the concept =12. For Kant to make his case, he needs to appeal to some principle like the following: the structure of concepts (in the objective sense) of the word can be read off of the way in which they are represented in our minds. Facts about our grasp of concepts must parallel facts about the concepts themselves. So if my grasp of 7+5 doesn’t comprise my grasp of =12, then the first concept doesn’t comprise the latter. Once that principle is granted, Kant’s argument goes through. But why grant it? What is the motivation for...",

    "text": "IV. Let us now give Kant’s answers to the questions just posed. How do you know that 7+5=12? Not through conceptual analysis. Not through the senses. You learn it through an act of the imagination. You imagine seven objects laid next to five other objects, and then see that the resulting aggregate comprises exactly 12 objects. How do you know that a straight line is the shortest between two points? Not through conceptual analysis. Not through the senses. You must have a certain kind of para-sensory experience: you must imagine a line connecting two dots. Kant refers to images of this sort as “intuitions.” So it is through “intuition” that you learn the truth of 7+5=12. It must be made clear that Kant is not using this term in the way it is used today. These days, philosophers usually use the term to refer to a putative insight into concepts (“my intuition is that killing someone is morally worse than passively allowing him to die”). This is not what Kant means. By “intuition” Kant means an act of imaging: a kind of para-perception. Let us continue with Kant’s story. How exactly do these para-perceptual experiences reveal the truth of 7+5=12? The idea seems to be as follows. First of all, these para-sensory experiences don’t show conceptual or logical necessity. Kant’s whole point is that the concepts involved in 7+5=12 do not, by themselves, guarantee its truth. Taken by themselves, those concepts are consistent with the truth of 7+5≠12. So the para-perceptions that teach us the truth of 7+5=12 do not do so by apprising us of necessary relations holding among the components of that proposition. At the same time, those para-sensory experiences don’t tell us anything about the external world: you can’t learn anything new about the external world through an act of imagination. So, for Kant, these para-perceptual experiences show neither empirical truth nor conceptual necessity. What they show is representational necessity. They show us facts, not about the world or about concepts, but about how we must sense-perceive the world. These para-perceptual experiences show us what we can and cannot represent in imagery. We cannot form an image of a straight line between two points that is longer than some other line between those two points. We cannot form an image of four apples that isn’t also an image of two apples and two other apples. Let us...",

    "text": "This may be true. (In my view, it is true.) But it is just what Kant cannot, and does not, say. He thinks that 7+5=12 is such that its truth is not guaranteed by the concepts composing that statement. So the representational limitations he has in mind do not have a purely conceptual or logical foundation. In Kant’s view, these necessities are really of a psychological nature. Our “forms of thought” are such that we must see the world (literally see it) as being such that, in it, parallel lines don’t meet, a straight line is the shortest distance between two points, two objects coupled with two other objects make four objects, and so on. We are wired in such a way that we (though perhaps not other life forms) must see objects as being in a space and time with a certain structure: a structure that does not permit parallel lines to meet, that does not permit 2+2 to equal 3, and so on. So “intuition”, i.e. para-perceptual experience, shows us how we must sense-perceive the world. IV. Is there any room in this picture for synthetic a priori truth or for knowledge thereof? Both questions must be answered with a “no”. My argument for this owes much to Laurence Bonjour. For the sake of argument, let us concede a couple of key assumptions to Kant. First, let’s concede that we do sense-perceive the world as being such that, in it, 7+5=12, a straight line is the shortest distance between two points, parallels don’t meet, and so on. Second, let’s concede that we learn these facts about how we perceive the world through “intuition” (some kind of para-perceptual experience). Given only that we are psychologically compelled to see the world as being such that, in it, thus and such is the case, it doesn’t follow that thus and such really is the case. A psychotic may be psychologically compelled to see pink elephants, but that doesn’t mean there are pink elephants. So our para-sensory experiences don’t tell us anything about the world, but only (at most) about how we perceive it. They tell us not that 7+5 really equals 12, but only that we are psychologically compelled to sense-perceive the world as being such that, in it, 7+5=12. Actually, Kant himself admits this. These intuitions, he says, tell us about the “phenomenal” world, not the “noumenal” world. By Kant’s...",

You are not learning something that holds in virtue of facts about our cognitive machinery. Nothing about circles has anything to do with our cognitive machinery. When we do learn facts about geometry or perhaps arithmetic through an exercise of powers of imaging, we are engaging in conceptual analysis, the vehicle for which, in those cases, happens to be mental imagery. There is no reason why images should not mediate conceptual analysis. So given only that some truth is discovered through thought involving mental imagery, it doesn’t follow that it is synthetic. What led Kant astray was a failure to distinguish the different roles that mental imagery can play in the acquisition of knowledge. Kant noted that mental imagery is a kind of para-perception. He concluded from this that, when mental imagery is involved in the discovery of some truth, that truth is synthetic – like those truths that we use perception to discover. The idea is that, if the truth in question were purely conceptual, then we wouldn’t need to use para-perception to ascertain it. But that is simply false. If somebody asks me “what is the minimum number of sides a solid can have?”, I base my answer on a mental image that I produce. I imagine trying to produce a solid out of four sides, then note that it doesn’t work, then try to do the same thing with five sides, and note that it does work. But surely the fact that a solid has to have a minimum of five sides is not synthetic. That proposition holds entirely in virtue of mathematics – in virtue of the structure of the concepts five and solid and so forth. It is true that I rely to some extent on imagery to learn this truth. But the imagery is a vehicle for conceptual analysis. It might seem that Kant did show that we have some a priori knowledge: we have a priori knowledge of facts about the phenomenal world, i.e. about how we must perceive the world. We know a priori that the world, as we perceive it, is such that parallel lines don’t meet in it,...",

    "text": "In the end, “transcendental” necessity reduces either to mere psychological necessity or to conceptual necessity. We cannot coherently think of a world where triangles have two sides or where 2+2=3. That is because propositions like 2+2=3 and triangles have two sides are conceptually false and consequently draw a limit to what we can conceive of. What cannot be conceived cannot be perceived. Conceptual necessities thus impose sharp limits on how the world can be visually represented. So it is clear how conceptual falsity translates into representational impossibility. At the same time, if a proposition is conceptually possible, then it is hard to see why it would be representationally impossible to grasp it. Because we have certain cognitive machinery -- certain “forms of thought” -- we are compelled to see the world in a certain way. But unless those forms of thought embody conceptual necessities of some kind, I don’t see why we couldn’t, in principle, have different forms of thought. We could obviously imagine having a cognitive architecture such that we could only see two different colors or hear two different pitches. Under those circumstances, given the forms of thought operative in our sense-perception, we simply couldn’t see a third color or hear a third pitch. But obviously it is conceptually possible that there be more than two colors. (It is actual; so it is possible.) So it is representationally possible. In conclusion, while there are limits to what our perceptual machinery can do, it is unclear why these limits could be necessary unless they were grounded in conceptual, i.e. strictly analytic, impossibilities.",

    "text": "VIII. There is an incoherence in Kant’s thinking more radical than any mentioned so far. He rightly wants to hold that propositions like 7+2=9 and the area of a (Euclidean) triangle is ½ the base×height are a priori. But he also says that we sense-perceive the world as being such that these propositions are true in it. Of course, if the world can be seen (literally seen) as being such that, in it, 7+2=9 is true, then 7+9=12 is descriptive of the spatiotemporal world. If 7+2=9 said absolutely nothing about the spatiotemporal world, then the truth or falsity of that proposition couldn’t make any difference to how the spatiotemporal world seemed to us. So, on Kant’s view, these propositions say something about the spatiotemporal world. But, as Frege clearly stated, 7+2=9 doesn’t say anything about the spatio-temporal world; it doesn’t say that if you hold up two fingers and then hold up seven fingers, nine fingers are on display. For there could, in principle, be a causal law that falsified just that sort of statement – a law that didn’t allow more than five fingers to be simultaneously on display in a certain region. The same is true of Kant’s claim that we must sense-perceive the world as being such that, in it, straight lines are the shortest distances between pairs of points. The proposition a straight line is the shortest distance between two points says nothing at all about the spatio-temporal world; it defines a certain kind of space. Of course, there are empirical propositions – concerning light rays and point-masses – that are analogous to that purely mathematical proposition. But surely Kant doesn’t have these in mind when he says it is a priori that a straight line is the shortest distance between two points. So Kant’s position is self-undermining. He needs mathematical propositions to be two things at once. They must be descriptive of the world: they must say something about beams of light. But they must also not be descriptive of the world: they must not be capable of falsification by anything having to do with beams of light and the like. A Kantian might reply by saying:",

We have experience; we have sequences of thoughts and perceptions that cohere. The world is intelligible to us. We sense-perceive it and about it. Up to a point, our perceptions and thoughts are accurate. In Kant’s view, given the very fact that these things are true, we can deduce certain things about the structure of the world. Given only that we have coherent ideation, the world must satisfy certain minimal conditions. Kant refers to those conditions as “transcendental”: they are the conditions that are necessarily satisfied by any world in which there are entities that have coherent, if not always accurate, thoughts and representations. The “necessity” just mentioned is not causal: it is of a deeper kind. A “transcendental argument” is one having the form: given only that we have experiences of such and such a kind, it follows that the world must have thus and such features. Kant gives transcendental arguments for many things. I think that some of these arguments are cogent, provided that we make some terminological changes. Where Kant talks about “synthetic a priori”, we should instead talk of “hard analytic.” This minor adjustment de-psychologizes Kant’s arguments, and enables them to go through. I will argue that there is an analytic connection – a hard analytic connection, but an analytic connection no less – between the proposition there exist beings who have the cognitive wherewithal to raise metaphysical questions and propositions concerning the structure of the world itself. I will also argue for another significant claim. Consider the following propositions: any two events are related in space or in time; there are causal relations among states of affairs; objects are not mere bundles of properties, but are things in which properties inhere; human beings are not mere bundles of perceptions (or thoughts), but are things in which such entities inhere. These propositions describe the world. I will argue that, just as Kant maintained, each of those propositions is entailed by the proposition there exist beings who have the cognitive wherewithal to raise questions (of any kind at all).",

Hume said that there are sequences and regularities of events, but that there is never any kind of internal connection holding among them. For event x to cause event y is just for the sequence consisting of x followed by y to instantiate a general regularity. Hume’s analysis is counter-intuitive. It very much seems that pushing the button makes the computer turn on, that flipping the switch makes the light turn on. Understandably, Kant wanted to do justice to that intuition. He tries to justify this intuition with a transcendental argument. (Here I will give a transcendental argument for that view; whether it is Kant’s own argument, or even one he would consider credible, is an exegetical question I wish to avoid.) Imagine a world where there is no causation, where there are merely sequences of events. Such a world would comprise nothing enduring. This is because persistence is itself a causal notion. If something persists, there is ipso facto a causal sequence of some kind. So where there is no causation, there is no persistence. Where there is no persistence, there is no coherent ideation. For surely, as a matter of necessity, a coherent thought process involves some kind of persistence. So given only the fact that there are beings who have the ability to raise questions about anything, let alone about the necessary preconditions for experience, it follows that causal relations do not consist in mere sequences of events, but in internal relations of some kind. But notice that this transcendental argument turns on the existence of entirely analytic connections among propositions; no “synthetic a priori” is involved. Given the very concept of a rational thought process, it follows that analytically there are causal relations among events. The analyticity in question is hard analyticity, but it is analyticity no less. In the next section, I will attempt to show that Kant-style transcendental arguments are capable of settling some important questions concerning scientific explanation and knowledge in general.",

This must be qualified. Logical relations hold, not between states of affairs, but between pieces of information. Typically, these pieces of information are held to be sentences or propositions. Once it is revised to accommodate these facts, Hume’s position becomes: “if A and B are distinct events, then there is no strictly logical connection between the proposition A occurs and the proposition B occurs.” But this last statement, in its turn, is true only when subject to a heavy qualification. Depending on how we describe A and B, a proposition affirming the existence of the one might entail one affirming the existence of the other. To take a trivial example, this would be the case if we described A as the cause of B or if we described B as one of the successors of A. For Hume’s argument to go through, we must find some non-tendentious way of describing A and B. At first, this seems easy to do. Suppose I push the button and the elevator comes a moment later.

Of course, we sometimes speak about instantaneous states of affairs. But, it is now generally held, such talk is elliptical for talk of arbitrarily short, non-instantaneous states of affairs. When we say that such that such and such is what obtains at a given instant t, we mean that what obtains during smaller and smaller intervals containing t approximates arbitrarily well to such and such. The most obvious illustrations of this principle involve statements about velocity. There can be no movement, and hence no velocity, at an instant. When we say that x is moving with velocity v at instant t, we mean that as we consider smaller and smaller intervals containing t, x’s velocity during those intervals comes arbitrarily close to v. But exactly similar considerations warrant the view that there can no instantaneous temperature, mass, color, shape, spin, and so on. There are no strictly non-dynamic spatiotemporal properties – no property such that possession of it doesn’t involve movement. So for reasons exactly similar to those warranting the rejection of instantaneous velocity, we must reject the notion of anything instantaneous. A corollary is that there is no complete description of any state of affairs that does not say what happens over a stretch of time. An argument exactly similar to the one just given establishes that no state of affairs occupies an unextended point. Of course, we say that such and such is the case at a certain point p. But that means that as we consider smaller and smaller regions of space intervals including p, what obtains approximates arbitrarily well to such and such. The statement “the temperature at point p is 88°” is in the same category as “x is moving 54 mph at instant t.” Both are meaningless unless taken as elliptical for limit-statements of the sort just discussed. Now let us turn our attention back to A and B. Consider all the events, down to the last electron-jump, that are involved in the button’s being pushed.

I would go further, and say that talk of instants and points is itself talk of arbitrarily small, or arbitrarily short, occurrences. (Here I am following others, including Whitehead, Russell, and Einstein himself.) It isn’t logically or epistemologically possible to start with empty points and instants, then fill them (so to speak) with states of affairs, and then build spatio-temporally extended events out of those. Instead, we must start with events and, on that basis, work our way backwards towards points and instants. There are no minimal events. To say that space-time consists of points and instants, as opposed to granules of non-null size, is to say that events have an “analogue”, and not a “digital”, structure. (A sentence is a digital representation: it has minimal units of significance. A photograph does not have minimal units of significance, and is thus analogue.) That events have an analogue, as opposed to a digital, structure neither follows from, nor is rendered possible by, the fact that space-time consists of points and instants. Rather, space-time’s consisting of instants and points is identical with events’ not having a digital structure. As we’ve noted, linguistic representations decompose into minimal parts. This seems to be a defining fact about language, at least of the languages we use in discursive contexts. (Artistic expression often involves an analogue medium. So if, as some maintain, such media are actually languages, then there are non-digital languages.) This reflects the fact that it is hard for us to understand what we cannot digitize. (It is also a possibility that discursive understandings consists in digitization, at least up to a point.) It also reinforces a pre-existing tendency to associate understanding with deconstruction into minimal, discrete parts. The belief that space and time are composed of points strikes me as a projection into the physical world of this fact about language. The belief that temporally extended events must be built out of non-extended events is sheer anthropomorphism, and is thus to be put in the same category as the view that rocks fall because being near the earth reduces their anxiety level.",

    "text": "IV. Once it is granted that discourse about points and instants is elliptical for discourse about extended (but arbitrarily small or short) events, the problem ceases to be how to establish a necessary connection between distinct events, but rather how to prevent any two events from having such a connection. Hume assumes that there are entirely non-causal descriptions of states of affairs. Billiard ball X rolls into billiard ball Y. X stops, and Y starts rolling. The causal connection, says Hume, consists only in the fact that the situation just described is an instance of some regularity. What Hume doesn’t realize is that each of the statements involved in describing that scenario is replete with causal content. X’s rolling is causal; so for that matter is Y’s standing still (relative to the pool-table). The persistence of each of those objects is itself a causal fact. We tend to think of causation as involving some sort of disruption. The mere persistence of Y is not, we feel, sufficiently disruptive to involve any kind of causality; neither is the mere rolling of X. The problem with this viewpoint is that the concept of a disruption has only a psychological or pragmatic significance. From a purely physical standpoint, the transference of motion from X to Y is no more disruptive, no greater a change, than X’s rolling or Y’s persistence. This is not to mention that, given the relativity of motion, what counts as mere persistence as opposed to motion is framework-relative. Hume’s puzzle thus presupposes a highly anthropomorphic conception of causality: there are causal relations only where there are events that are psychologically disruptive. But such a conception is no basis for any analysis of causality. Given a correct conception of what instants and points are, we may conclude that, given a complete description of A and B, those events turn out to be no less contingently related to each other than are the square of three and the predecessor of ten. The considerations generally cited to the contrary are artifacts of tendentious descriptions of the events in question. Hume’s analysis of the concept of “force” is beyond reproach. But that analysis is moot since, contrary to what Hume held, we don’t need forces to connect cause and effect. Hume is also right that there is no necessity other than logical necessity. Philosophers have had one of two reactions to this. Either...",

It follows that any description of anything spatiotemporal is itself a causal description. If that is right, then it is not possible even to articulate Hume’s objections to causality. Recognition of (O) was forced on us by empirical discoveries, in particular by Relativity Theory. But is (O) itself an empirical statement? I think not. If there is no possible causal connection between E and E*, then it makes little sense to say that they have any spatial or temporal position with respect to each other. If there is no conceivable way that anything could travel from the place of E to the place of E*, then it is unclear what it would mean to say that E and E* were separated by such and such a distance. Similar considerations make it hard to believe that, absent some kind of causal relation between them, one of those events could be meaningfully described as coming before the other. It seems, then, that (O) is less like all and only rhenates are chordates than it is like all and only triangles are regions bounded by three coplanar lines such that any two of them, but not all three, intersect. VI. Hume famously argued that there are no strictly logical grounds for the view that every event must have a cause – that there are no ex nihilo events. His argument is simple: propositions alleging uncaused events, e.g. the newspaper spontaneously combusted, are not self-contradictory. Since what is not self-contradictory is possible, ex nihilo creation and change is therefore possible. This is a corollary of the view that propositions assigning causal relations to pairs of events never have a strictly logical foundation. It is therefore to be expected that Hume’s argument for the possibility of ex nihilo creation involves the fallacies we’ve just been considering. For E and E* to be spatio-temporally co-located is for them to be causally related. The spatio-temporal manifold would comprise ex nihilo (uncaused) events only if it comprised events that were not co-located with other events – only if it comprised events that it didn’t comprise. I believe that Hume’s analysis of induction is bound up with his belief in the logical possibility of ex nihilo creation. As we’ve just seen, the latter belief is itself an application of his...",

    "text": "By “spatio-temporal continuity”, I propose to mean the kind of continuity had by series of states of affairs -- as opposed to, say, series of numbers. Henceforth the term “continuity” will be elliptical for “spatio-temporal continuity.” With the help of this new terminology, we may now sum up our findings. Hume’s conception of causality involves a falsely “digital” conception of spatiotemporal reality. In his view, each region of space and of time is a distinct box that can be filled with a state of affairs. If the contents of one of those boxes are replaced or annihilated, that has no ramifications as far as the other boxes are concerned. The spatio-temporal world is thus, almost by definition, completely permutation-friendly. Given this viewpoint, it becomes trivially impossible to establish any causal relations between distinct events. The permutation-friendliness definitive of spatio-temporal location, as Hume understands it, is identical with the absence of causal connections between distinct states of affairs. But this conception of spatio-temporal relations cannot be sustained, as the following argument shows. Persistence is a causal phenomenon. Spatio-temporal continuity is a form of persistence. Consequently, continuity is a causal phenomenon. By definition, continuity has no place in a digital system. Hume’s “demonstration” that there are no causal relations (or that such relations reduce to regularities) is thus an artifact of his assumption that space and time have a structure comparable to that of an array of digits. But that assumption question-beggingly presupposes the very conception of causality that Hume is trying to defend. I said that “continuity involves persistence.” At first this seems false. Imagine an object that is changing continuously in every respect – mass, motion, shape, and so on. Surely, we will be told, that doesn’t involve persistence. But it does. The chair you are sitting on is a paradigm case of persistence. But it is now changing along all those dimensions. Every case of persistence is a case of continuous change. What we describe as changes are actually changes in the manner of change. They are higher-order changes. So there is no continuity without persistence, just as our argument supposes. VII. Hume’s tendency to digitize blinds him to the logical basis of induction, since induction, as I will now argue, consists in positing exactly those continuities that would “de-digitize” our description of reality.

    "text": "VIII. Ultimately, our perceptions are, as Hume himself insists, our only source of information about the spatiotemporal world. Hume is therefore right to say that, like all other empirical beliefs, our inductions can be justified only by sensory experience. Where Hume goes astray is in his failure to register a crucial fact about sensory information. The content of a perception doesn’t decompose in the same way as the content of the propositions that we would typically use to report those perceptions. If I see a swan, I will say “I see a swan; it is white; it is eating a fish…” But my perception doesn’t have a corresponding breakdown. It isn’t as though a single part of my perception corresponds to the concept swan, another to the concept eating, and so on. What is reported by such a proposition is not the content of the perception itself, but rather a judgment about the content of that perception. Describing such propositions as “data” is like identifying a court’s finding of guilty with the actuality of guilt. There is thus a sense in which (a)-(a4) are not the data that motivate (or legitimate) belief in (b). (a)-(a4) are not data, but meta-data. We cannot work backwards from meta-data to data. That is like trying recover the subtle inflections of a person’s speech from a court-stenographer’s transcript. (In fact, that would be a special case of the principle we are considering.) The logical basis for induction is precisely what is lost in the process of digitization involved in embodying one’s knowledge in (a)-(a4). When you see a white swan, what your perception gives you is a continuous state of affairs. When you induce, on the basis of your perceptions, that all swans are white, you don’t have in mind the sort of “data” embodied in propositions like (a)-(a4). You have in mind the kind of data that leads to, but is quite distinct from, a belief in such propositions. The data that actually motivates your belief in (b) is embodied in analogue representations. What is given to you in such representations is never a discrete state but, at most, a relatively discrete state of affairs. Any given perception presents a continuous reality. It is a datum that what is given to you in a given perception is spatio-temporally co-located with what is given to you in other perceptions. (It might seem that this...",

We must also remember that the state of affairs described by (A) would have a much richer structure than (A) itself. The rock’s flying away would not be an ultimate, primitive event. It would supervene in innumerable others -- some perceptible, some not. The propositions describing some of these constituent states of affairs would involve rather obvious discontinuities with the events in their neighborhoods. (A) itself seems innocuous. There doesn’t seem to be any problem fitting the event it describes into a coherent narrative. Such a viewpoint, I think, confuses the proposition with the reality. Propositions have discrete, easily replaced parts. States of affairs do not. Hume holds that counter-inductive beliefs like (A) involve unusual, but otherwise acceptable, permutations of objects and properties. I would agree that (A) itself can be so described. But states of affairs cannot be understood in combinatorial terms; they don’t consist of discrete, replaceable parts. They don’t consist of parts whose replacements can even coherently be thought. When we say that we can coherently think some such replacement, we are, I believe, making a statement about the logical properties of the corresponding propositions. This means that we are tendentiously stripping our representations of those states of affairs of information that, if left in, would render such intersubstitutions logically impermissible.",

When this constraint is taken into account, the logical permissibility of inferences like (A) becomes more questionable than Hume makes it out to be. A metaphor from music may help. Given any short sequence of notes, there are innumerably many musically feasible combinations of notes may follow it. But in a musical composition, it is not enough that each bar not clash with the bar preceding it; any two bars have to fit with the bars flanking them; and those four bars must fit with the two bars flanking them; and so on. What is musically possible given any one bar is usually not possible in a broader context. There are many ways to replace bar 58 of Mendelssohn’s Italian Symphony without ruining bars 57-58. But, as we’ve just seen, it would be absurd to infer from this that there are equally many ways to replace bar 58 without ruining the whole symphony, or even there are any viable replacements. Hume’s conception of induction involves a similar fallacy. When we say that (A) is merely counter-inductive, we are excluding two types of information. First, we are considering only propositional data (we’ve already considered the effects of this). Second, the propositions we select for special attention are not the only ones that embody that relevant data.

Just as Bob has instinctive beliefs about why he loves Mary, so we have instinctive beliefs about why we think we believe that the pan is hot. I am not talking about our beliefs as to why the pan is hot. In my view, such first-order beliefs are typically cogent. I am referring to our beliefs as to why we have those beliefs. Those meta-beliefs can no more be regarded as authoritative than can Bob’s stated answer about why loves Mary. If you ask Bob “why do you believe that the fire is hot?”, he will say “because every other fire I’ve seen turned out to be hot”, or some such. (To simplify discussion, I am assuming that Bob is reasonably articulate, and doesn’t answer with a shrug or a circularity like “I don’t know, I guess because fire is hot.”) The answer that Bob would give would, in fact, not be very different from the answer that a Hume or a Karl Popper would give. If that answer were accurate and exhaustive, then Bob’s belief would indeed have no rational basis. But the psychological mechanisms that generate that answer are less directly connected to the forces that shaped Bob’s belief than they are to Bob’s Pavlovian theories about why has that belief.

It is not that those associative mechanisms give us the wrong information. They typically point us in the right direction: my psychological association of fire with heat grounds a correct belief. But our associations refer us to singularities, and not to underlying continuities. Given that association is an affect-driven process, it is to be expected that it will refer us to emotionally pregnant breakdowns in the uptake of perceptual information, and not to the smooth flow of information mediating between such cataclysms. Of course, there is no way to work backwards from such decontextualized data-points to the logical underpinnings of our theories. When we try to do so, we run into the problems identified by Hume. But this doesn’t mean that there is no logical basis for induction; it corresponds only to the trivial fact that we can’t recover the logical basis of our inductions from degenerate representations of that basis -- representations that highlight what is emotionally (or affectively) significant, and leave everything else out. Our experience gives us smooth curves. Our sentential representations of our experience (“past fires have been hot”) give us isolated points that are compatible with infinitely many different curves. On this basis, Hume and others say that there is no logical basis for induction. But that doesn’t follow, since the justification for our inductions lies in the smooth curves of experience, and not in the jagged edges of our descriptions thereof. Hume’s views on induction are thus artifacts of his own methods. Given an association-driven review of our inductive-practices, it is indeed going to be impossible to recover the logic that underlies them. By their very nature, such associations leave out emotionally sterile, but logically crucial, connecting information. Hume’s empiricism as a whole is a study of artifacts. Since, in his system, knowledge is identified with sequences of images, it follows trivially that reality must be understood in terms of the associative-mechanisms governing such sequences. Being affect-driven, such sequences track disruptions, skipping over the emotionally neutral periods that intervene. A reality seen through the lens of such processes will inevitably consist of singularities – as breakdowns in the conditions that permit causal and inductive explanation.",

A given proposition (e.g. John is eating chicken) has a structure that is not remotely comparable to that of the corresponding reality or to that of the perceptual data through which we learn about that reality. Causation is bound up with continuity – with the very features of reality that resist the sort of digitization associated with sentences. Finally, the viability of induction is bound up with the existence of causal mechanisms linking states of affairs. All of this is obvious. It therefore follows from what is obvious that the logical relations holding between two propositions will not typically do justice to the relations of necessitation (causal and explanatory) holding between the corresponding states of affairs. There must, I would therefore suggest, be a purely emotional basis our failure to see this, and for our subsequent willingness to accept Hume’s otherwise unpalatable nihilism regarding causation and induction. In a moment, I will try to identify that emotional factor. But first I would like to identify another symptom of it. Throughout its history, logic has been identified with the logic of sentences or of para-sentential entities like propositions. But, as we’ve seen, not all data is embodied in sentences. The existence of digital representations, like sentences, is parasitic on that of non-digital representations. So ultimately data is always embodied in media that are not only not sentences, but lack the defining feature of sentences: namely, decomposability into minimal units of significance. The concept of information is inseparable from concepts like entailment and compatibility. So obviously logical relations hold among analogue-information, and are not confined to sentences. Sentence-logic is therefore but one kind of logic and, in light of the derivative nature of digital information, is a fairly superficial kind of logic. The identification of sentence-logic with logic as a whole is so obviously false that we must wonder what induced us to acquiesce to it. I believe that acquiescence to be motivated, at least in part, by a wish to rationalize the tendentious and emotion-driven conception of reality embodied in Hume’s empiricism. Our acceptance of Hume’s analyses of causation and induction, despite their obvious discordance with everything we believe, is a special case of that acquiescence and is thus an expression of that same wish.

But if we say that the truth of (#) is a primitive, then the truth of (O) and (P) would acquire an accidental status; the tight connection between temporal order and causality would become a kind of coincidence. To avoid the theoretical arbitrariness associated with such a position, we must say that (#) is true exactly if there is some actual causal process beginning with E and ending with E*, the same being true of any other statement regarding temporal (or, for exactly similar reasons, spatial) order. Given this, here is the system I would propose. We start by taking the notions event and cause as primitive. For E to come before E* is for E is to be a cause of E*. For those events to be simultaneous is for neither to be a cause of the other. At first, it might seem absurd to take the notion of a cause as primitive. But a moment’s thought shows it to be de rigueur and also exposes another cavity in Hume’s reasoning. Obviously the concept of causality is embedded within the concept of an event. As we saw earlier, there are no instantaneous events: if E1 has no causal relation to E2, then (unless they are simultaneous) they are ipso facto not parts of the same event. So if we take the concept of an event as primitive – and we must, given the points made a moment ago about space and time – then we must do the same with the concept of a cause.",

Since E and E* are simultaneous exactly if there is no causal connection between them, we may say that an instant in time is the class of all events such that there is no causal connection between any two of them. In fact, unless we take the position just described, it becomes an accident, as opposed to a conceptual necessity, that there are no causal connections between simultaneous states of affairs. Conceptual, i.e. analytic connections, betoken an identity, or overlap, of content. Given this, we must follow Whitehead and Russell in identifying instants with classes of non-interacting states of affairs. For two distinct events to be in different places, it is sufficient that neither be a cause of the other. At the same time, that is obviously not necessary, since events in different places can be causally related. (I push the button in place p, and the elevator starts moving in place p*.) For this reason, if we are to complete our analysis of the concept of location, we need to take into the fact that location is relative to a framework. Relative to the earth, I have been in the same place for the last ten minutes. Relative to the sun, I have moved several miles. Whenever we talk about “the same place”, we must identify the relevant framework. This means that we stipulate that some causal process – say the Earth or a beam of light – is to constitute a given place. In this way, we can complete our analysis of the concept of location. Two distinct events E and E* are in different places exactly if either",

(C2) may seem circular since it includes the expression “in the same place.” But the circularity is merely apparent since, in this context, the phrase “x and y are in the same place” is simply short-hand for “x and y are both segments of the causal sequence that defines the relevant framework.” Of course, the concept of location is presumably not disjunctive; so it is incumbent on us to reduce (C1) and (C2) to a single condition.

    "text": "VI. I believe that Hume’s positivism has cast long and dark philosophical shadows. In what remains of this paper, I would like to identify, and then suggest alternatives to, some of the fallacies that Hume’s thought has generated. It is commonplace in epistemology that the cause of a belief must be distinguished from the justification for it. Suppose you believe that 3+3=6 because you were told this by the leader of the cult to which you belong. In that case, the experiences that caused you to have a certain belief do not justify your having it. Now suppose that you believe that 3+3=6 because you have performed the requisite computations. In that case, the experiences that caused you to have that belief do justify your having that belief. The distinction between the cause and the justification of a belief is obviously a legitimate one. Whenever a belief is irrational, its cause fails to constitute a justification. But thanks to the influence of Hume’s thought, this distinction has been over-extended, resulting in some implausible and sterile views concerning the acquisition of scientific knowledge. Newton’s innovations resulted from his having certain experiences. Did those experiences justify those innovations or did they merely lead to them? If we say that they merely led to them, then we are saying that Newton was not being rational in formulating the conclusions that he did formulate; we are saying that he is in the same category as a cult member who blindly accepts everything that the cult-leader says. But surely this would not be an accurate characterization of Newton’s thought-process. A number of thinkers – Kant, Chomsky, and Jerry Fodor among them – respond to this by saying, in effect, that Newton innately knew the physical principles that he appeared to derive from experience. They don’t deny that experience has an important role in Newton’s becoming aware of these principles. But they say that, for the most part, experience merely triggered the activation of the relevant, innate cognitive structures. Fodor admits that it seems as though this knowledge is in fact derived from experience. (To my knowledge, Kant and Chomsky do not address this issue. But Fodor has, I believe, done an excellent job of making it clear what they are committed to saying, given their views.) But he says that this is because the experiences that trigger the activation of these cognitive structures happen to...",

    "text": "§ Supposing that Kant and Chomsky are right, what explains the fact that we have all of this innate knowledge? Chomsky’s answer is: “evolution.” It is thanks to 500 million years of evolution that our innate cognitive structure is so closely hewed to the objective structure of the world. Kant’s answer is that we don’t have any knowledge, or even any experience, of any genuinely objective (non-psychological) reality. The world that we experience is a world of our own making. The innate so-called knowledge we’ve been speaking of has no objective counterpart, and thus isn’t knowledge at all. Kant’s answer is hard to accept. It seems a datum that we have knowledge of the external world. At first, Chomsky’s answer seems better than Kant’s. But this, I believe, is an illusion. Given only that evolution has deposited certain ideas in our physiological structure, it doesn’t follow that those ideas are knowledge. That would follow only if the act of depositing were mediated by some kind of rational cognitive process (unless, of course, one advocates an extremely revisionist conception of knowledge, whereby knowledge is the result of a long run of dumb-luck). But if there were there such a process, then it wouldn’t be necessary to appeal to evolution to explain our ability to make correct extrapolations from our sensory data. If there existed a process of the sort just discussed, ontogeny could do what, according to Chomsky, is done by phylogeny (evolution). But in that case, it would be unnecessary to bring phylogeny into the picture at all. If there is no way to acquire inductive and theoretical knowledge except by having the right innate ideas, then evolution is no more capable than the individual in side-stepping the obstacles identified by Hume. Chomsky’s nativism is really a way of passing the buck from the individual onto evolution. But it is left unexplained how evolution can discharge that function. Chomsky does give a kind of solution to this problem. The individual lives only a few decades, whereas evolution has been going on for hundreds of millions of years. Therefore, even though there is, in this context, no principled difference between the individual’s personal and his ancestral experience – even though the difference has to do solely with the amount of time involved, and has no systemic basis -- evolution is nonetheless better equipped than personal experience to whip us into epistemic...",

    "text": "§ If the evolutionary (pre-established-harmony) story were the right one, we would have no epistemic plasticity at all. Because, in actuality, the individual’s epistemic relation to the world involves the mediation of rational cognitive mechanisms, he can easily make allowances for changes in the stream of data that he is constantly uploading through his senses. But if, as the evolutionary story would have us believe, the individual’s epistemic relation to the external world were merely causal, he would be epistemically paralyzed the moment he stepped outside of the specific experiential corridors within which evolution allowed his cognitive mechanisms to operate. We are not subject to such instantaneous paralyses. Obviously our biological structure imposes strict limits on our intellectual development. But even after we allow for this fact, we are not cognitively frozen in the way that the Kant-Chomsky would have us be. No matter how unusual the circumstances, and no matter how little evolutionary precedent those circumstances have, our ability to make at least minimally adequate inductive inferences never vanishes. We are not given to the kind of inductive black-outs that, if the evolutionary story were the right one, would pepper our cognitive lives. In the final analysis, Chomsky and Kant say that, give or take a few nuances, we are born knowing everything we will ever know. Experience merely activates latent knowledge; its role is purely causal, never rational. But this is a way of saying that we have no knowledge. We can avoid this less than satisfying position if we see induction as a logical process. Our theoretical knowledge is obviously not limited to the stock of ideas that we are born with. Nobody was born knowing the inverse square law. Induction involves intelligence. Humean empiricism is inconsistent with this; and so, despite first appearances, is Chomskyan-Kantian nativism. Their nativism is not rationalism; it is species-empiricism, as opposed to individual-empiricism; and, notwithstanding the appearance of scientific rigor associated with the hallowed term “evolution”, their position is as incapable as Hume’s in allowing us to have any theoretical or inductive knowledge.",

    "text": "§ We have uncovered yet another irony of empiricism – or, at least, of Hume’s version of it. In rendering induction defunct, Hume makes it impossible to acquire any knowledge that transcends the deliverances of one’s senses at a given moment. (In fact, as Hume himself points out, even this knowledge is jeopardized.) The result is that all knowledge must be innate. Since we can’t learn anything, we must be born knowing everything that we ever come to know. Kant, Chomsky, and other illustrious rationalists have all unwittingly acquiesced to this aspect of Hume’s thought. On our view, it isn’t necessary to posit vast stock-piles of innate scientific knowledge. To be sure, there is innate knowledge. In fact, there are two quite distinct kinds. There is the innate contingent knowledge discussed earlier (e.g. the knowledge that breasts provide milk, that animals with fangs are to be avoided, and so on). But there is another – in this context, much more important – kind of innate knowledge. The cognitive machinery through which we acquire empirical knowledge would seem to be embody knowledge of conceptual truths. After all, some kind of knowledge is needed to see relations of bearing among empirical data and, thus, to synthesize such data into theories (and even – I believe, following Kant and David Marr – into perceptions). But the kind of knowledge that enables one to delineate the logical consequences of the information at one’s disposal is entirely analytic and non-empirical. So to explain our ratiocinative prowess, it isn’t necessary to suppose that we have any innate empirical knowledge. It therefore isn’t necessary to agree with the implausible view of Kant and Chomsky that we innately know Newtonian mechanics, and need only a modicum of sense-experience to activate this latent knowledge. Fortunately, it isn’t necessary to posit so much innate empirical knowledge to explain our success at forming theories. As we discussed earlier, it is probable that we have at least some empirical knowledge. But it is unlikely that our empirical knowledge includes the discoveries made by modern physicists. It is to the credit of our analysis of induction that it doesn’t require us to have any innate knowledge, being consistent with the possibility that we do not no less than with the possibility that we do. There are obviously some cases where the cause of a belief is distinct from its justification. But it is...",

    "text": "VII. Hume’s analysis has cast other shadows. On Hume’s view, nothing causes anything. Instead of causation, there are only regularities. To explain an event is thus to show only that it is an instance of some regularity. One problem with this conception of explanation is that it very much seems not to be true of psychological explanation. To explain a person’s conduct is to make that conduct intelligible; it is to show that it makes sense. To explain why Jim went the bank is not to show that his doing so is an instance of some regularity. It is to show why, given the operative conditions, it makes sense that Jim went to the bank. (Jim needs money to buy medicine for his ailing mother. His money is at the bank. He knows that he must go to the bank if he is to be able to use that money to fulfill his desire to buy medicine for his mother…) Of course, Jim’s behavior may well be an instance of many important regularities. It may well be true that everybody in circumstances relevantly like Jim’s engages in behavior relevantly like Jim’s. But, if so, the regularities in question presuppose, and merely express, the intelligible connections identified in psychological explanations like the one given a moment ago. The reason such regularities exist is that each of the specific situations in question is already amenable to the sort of explanation just discussed. People can understand their own conduct, at least within limits. (I say “within limits” in acknowledgement of the discoveries made by Freud, Chomsky, and other investigators of the unconscious.) You know, at least up to a point, why you just turned the light on, why you are now pushing certain buttons on a certain phone, why you are now angrily hanging up said phone, and so on. Your having this knowledge doesn’t involve your subsuming your behavior under general regularities. Of course, such regularities exist. But, first, you can, at least to a non-trivial extent, understand your behavior without having great stores of sociological knowledge and, second, the existence of sociological regularities is obviously a mere reflection of the internal connections of which you are already aware. § As just noted, it is fairly obvious that Hume’s conception of explanation is inapplicable to psychological phenomena.

    "text": "The problem is: how do we rule out (1)-(n-1)? How do we rule out those infinitely many explanatorily irrelevant regularities? Why are certain properties explanatory relevant (e.g. the property of being made of copper), whereas others are not (e.g. the property of being touched by a former junior class president)? Hume’s answer is that the right properties can be selected on purely statistical grounds. There are cases of light-bulbs that turn on in the absence of class presidents, but not (ceteris paribus) in the absence of the right sort of copper-wiring. But the very concept of a property is explanatorily pregnant, and cannot be used in this context without begging the question. As Clarence Lewis stressed in Mind and the World Order, for something to be copper (or water, or a table, or a bar of soap…) specifically is for it to have the right inductive and explanatory properties. Also, as Nelson Goodman showed, given any explanatorily useful property x, we can construct an explanatorily useless property y, such that x and y are indistinguishable from the viewpoint of any purely statistical conception of induction. Let us say that x is made of plopper exactly if x is either a piece of copper before the first instant of the year 2007 A.D. or x a piece of plastic after that time. Given the data that we’ve experienced thus far, i.e. as of the year 2006, there are no purely statistical grounds for preferring the hypothesis all copper (past, present, and future) conducts electricity to the hypothesis all plopper (past, present, and future) prefers electricity, and some copper after 2006 fails to do so. This exposes a certain circularity in Hume’s reasoning. Properties like copper, wet, soap, cotton – the properties in terms of which we understand the world – are not inductively or causally innocent, and do not correspond to purely phenomenal or otherwise theoretically uncommitted categories. The moment you describe something as copper, you are making various inductive and causal claims. So Hume’s arguments regarding causation and induction becoming tautologically false if they are stated in terms of any of the properties that we ordinarily use. Hume could avoid that problem by stating his arguments in terms of bent, Goodman-style predicates (“grue”, “plopper”) or, perhaps, in terms of purely phenomenal properties. But, in that case, those arguments would establish only the vacuity that inferentially inert expressions are inferentially inert....",

Event E is explained exactly if L conjoined with C1…Cn entails E, where L is a proposition describing a natural law and C1…Cn are propositions describing the conditions operative in the relevant area of space-time. What does Hempel mean by the term “law”? If he means a principled, i.e. an explanatorily significant, relationship, then his analysis is an empty tautology, as it amounts to this: E is explained exactly if there is an explanatorily significant regularity of which E is an instance. If his analysis is to be anything more than a tautology, Hempel must use the term “law” to denote a mere regularity. (This is, in fact, how Hempel meant it to be taken.) But in that case, his analysis runs into exactly the problems that we just pointed out. But even if we side-step this last problem, the Hempel-Hume analysis still fails. The physical world is characterized by many regularities (leaving aside the explanatorily sterile ones just discussed). But presumably these regularities express, and do not constitute, the existence of principled relationships. It is true that, given a light-bulb x that has a certain structure and is connected to a switch y by wire composed of a certain kind of material…if y is displaced by a certain amount at time t, then x will become luminescent at time t*. Our intuitive feeling is that this regularity is a consequence, and not the substance, of the some kind of principled relationship holding among the properties involved. If Hume’s analysis is right, this presumption is wrong. But if this presumption is wrong, then (despite the arguments to the contrary of many empiricists) the existence of this regularity becomes a coincidence of unspeakable proportions. For reasons already discussed, this problem vanishes if, instead of vainly and counter-intuitively trying to understand the concept of explanation in purely statistical terms, we give weight to our pre-Humean belief that explanations expose principled relationships. Our inhibitions to doing so vanish once we acknowledge the two main points of this paper, namely: propositions are merely models, and bad ones at that, of the analogue data given in sense-perception; and, second, space and time are not causally innocuous concepts.",

    "text": "VIII. Until the early 1960’s, the philosophy of science was dominated by the following viewpoint. Science organizes empirical data. Hypotheses are pictures or models of facts. Their correspondence, or lack thereof, with the facts can be decided rather straightforwardly – in essentially the same way that the veracity of a drawing can be decided. In some cases, a creative leap is needed to produce the right hypothesis. But that has nothing to do with the logical structure of the sciences. (Creative leaps are needed to see how to prove number-theoretic statements. But that doesn’t warrant any kind of subjectivism in regards to the concept of mathematical proof.) In a word, the results of scientific endeavor are embodied in general statements that either do or do not correspond with the facts, and what the facts are is to no degree a function of how we think or of how we represent those thoughts to one another (except, of course, in the special case where the facts in question concern our psychological occurrences or symbolic practices). In his book the Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Thomas Kuhn proposed a different picture. First of all, we must distinguish “normal” from “revolutionary” science. Revolutionary science consists in producing a new “paradigm”: a new framework within which research is to be conducted. A paradigm is not exactly a theory; it would be better described as a kind of meta-theory – a general outlook within which the construction of theories takes place. Normal science consists in fleshing out a paradigm. “Facts” and “data” are internal to paradigms. Given that facts must be understood in terms of the categories picked out by expressions like “cotton”, “wood”, “square” – i.e. given that facts must be understood in terms of the categories corresponding to our expressions – the paradigm-internal nature of facts reflects the truth (noted earlier) that empirical expressions are theoretically committed, and thus presuppose paradigms; and it also reflects the related truth that the methods we use for conducting research presuppose the truth of certain theories and, therefore, of paradigms. For example, we use mercury-thermometers because we have theories about the relative thermal co-efficients of expansion of various different substances. In Kuhn’s view, since facts are all internal to paradigms, empirical facts cannot warrant the acceptance or rejection of a given paradigm. Paradigms are to be accepted or rejected entirely on non-epistemic grounds. Einstein’s paradigm is not better...",
