    "text": "and (iii) There is no truth where there is disagreement. (i) is straightforwardly false, given that mathematics yields knowledge and that it isn’t an empirical discipline. Also, as we’ve seen, any given empirical discipline makes assumptions that it cannot justify and that it, unless they’re justified, that discipline fails to yield knowledge. So, supposing that, in (ii), the term “scientific knowledge” refers to the results generated by empirical sciences, it follows that (ii) is false. And supposing that, in (ii), that term refers, not just to empirical disciplines, but also to non-empirical disciplines (e.g. mathematics, philosophy), then what it says in no way implies that philosophy fails to yield knowledge. (iii) is easily shown to be false. If one person disagrees with another, at least one of those people must be wrong. If Smith thinks that 2+2=5 and Jones disagrees, his position being that 2+2=6, then, even though each has the wrong arithmetical belief, each is right to think that the other is wrong. If Smith thinks that 2+2=5 and Jones disagrees, his position being that 2+2=4, then, in addition to having the right arithmetical belief, Jones is right to think that Smith is wrong. So where there is disagreement, there is truth. Consequently, the alleged fact that there is more disagreement in philosophy than in other disciplines doesn't warrant the conclusion that there isn't such a thing as philosophical truth. 3.3. What philosophers agree about There probably is more disagreement within the discipline of philosophy than there is within most other disciplines. But in philosophical disagreements have nothing to do with the logical structure of discipline of philosophy and instead have to do with egos of the people involved in this disagreements. The problem isn't that there aren't agreed-upon methods of resolving disputes. Nor is the problem that people disagree as to how those methods are to be applied. The problem is that, for whatever reason, philosophers practically never admit that they're wrong. They are proven wrong---and, when this happens, they usually know it. But, when proven wrong, they respond, not by admitting that they’re wrong or even privately changing their views, but rather by coercing people over whom they power into towing their line. Since people don't depend for their well-being on how philosophical disputes are settled, market forces don't weed out bad philosophers the way they weed out bad doctors and engineers.

Answer: Kment’s adviser at Princeton was David Lewis (1940-2000). Like Kment, Lewis held that (2) is the correct analysis of (1) and that all statements of its kind are to be analyzed along the same lines.[12] In fact, this view, which is known as “modal realism,” is the cornerstone of Lewis’s work. Lewis was a philosophical genius and, in most philosophical contexts, was unusually flexible. But he wouldn’t budge when it came to modal realism. For him, that was a line in the sand: accept it or get lost. Kment accepted it. And, ten years after receiving his doctorate, he still does. In that time, everything he's published has been simply repeated or elaborated on points that he made in his dissertation. That said, Kment is tenured at one of the top ten departments in the country and I've been told more than once that he's one of the two or three finest philosophical minds of his generation.",

    "text": "Wittgenstein thus held that cannot experience pain without acting as though one is pain and, more generally, that what we refer to as “experiences” partly or entirely consist of the behaviors to which they tend to give rise. In his view, it isn't just what we think that is determined by how our bodies interact with those of others in our culture: what we feel is also so determined. In denying that thoughts had any existence apart from their overt manifestations, Wittgenstein was obliterating the distinction between voluntary and involuntary behavior. A voluntary movement is one that is caused by an intention on the part of the agent. But intentions are thoughts, or at least involve them; so, since Wittgenstein held that there is nothing to a person’s thoughts other than his body movements, he was effectively denying that there is any difference between involuntary movements (such as those involved in an epileptic fit) and voluntary ones (such as those involved in my typing this sentence). Wittgenstein’s view was that we’re zombies who don’t think or feel anything unless we wiggle and jiggle in culturally accepted ways. This is not a summary of his position. It is his position. If it sounds as though I’m ridiculing it, that’s only because I’m stating it clearly. To anyone who is not a hollowed out pseudo-person, these claims are brazenly absurd. I suspect that, in his attempt to describe the psyche, Wittgenstein was describing himself. For hundreds of pages, Wittgenstein insists that (i) Thought has no existence independently of overt bodily behavior,",

During Wittgenstein's 25 years at Cambridge and for several decades after his death, many of the brightest philosophers in Britain treated Wittgenstein’s views as simple truths. And most of those who didn’t agree with all of Wittgenstein's contentions didn‘t dare concede that, on the whole, his thinking was basically sound. As a result, some capable philosophers advocated some views that obviously no merit. For example, Norman Malcolm (1911), a hardcore Wittgensteinian, denied that people dream.[15] His argument: Dreams, supposing them to exist, are mental processes; and we know from Wittgenstein that we don’t have mental processes.",

    "text": "\"What about Strawson’s claim that “snow is white” and “it is true that snow is white” are synonymous? Surely that's got to be right.\" It is not. The first attributes a color to a substance. The second attributes a truth-value to a proposition; so the second, unlike the first, is only indirectly about snow. Consider the sentence: “it is probable that snow is white.” That sentence clearly concerns a proposition. Snow is either white or it isn’t. When you say that snow is probably white, you’re not saying that it’s vaguely white or that its whiteness is only semi-existent. You are saying that, in saying that snow is white one, what one is saying is more likely than not to be correct. The meaning had by the expression “that snow is white” in “it is probable that snow is white” coincides with counterpart in “it is true that snow is white.” So the latter, though equivalent with \"snow is white\", is about a proposition about snow, and therefore isn‘t in any direct sense about snow. “Snow is white“, on the other hand, clearly does directly concern snow. Two statements are equivalent if neither can possibly be true if the other is false. Strawson had precisely the sort of intelligence one needs to see that, for these reasons, “true” is meaningful. So why did Strawson say otherwise? Because Wittgenstein said otherwise. Why did Wittgenstein say otherwise? An integral part of Wittgenstein’s philosophical system is that meanings don’t exist. Wittgenstein granted that some noises were meaningful and that others weren’t; but he denied that there are such things as meanings. Why did Wittgenstein hold this? It's a corollary of his rejection of the presumption that a least part of what distinguishes my saying “it’s raining,” which is a genuinely linguistic act, from a coffee machine's accidentally making those the same noises, which is not a linguistic act, is that, in the first case but not the second, those noises resulted from intentions embodying certain beliefs (e.g. my belief that it's raining). A belief is necessarily a belief that such and such is the case: the object of a belief is always a proposition. A proposition is what one affirms when one makes a statement (e.g. when one sincerely says \"it's raining\"). Since Wittgenstein didn’t believe in beliefs, he didn’t believe in meanings; and since he didn’t believe in meanings, he didn’t think...",

    "text": "The philosopher is to the physicist what the physicist is to the engineer, and what the engineer is to the stranded motorist. It isn’t for its own sake that the philosopher wants to know what causes what and what mechanisms were involved. He is interested in this knowledge only to the extent that knowing this helps him understand what it is for one thing to cause another— only, that is to say, in so far as it helps him know what it is that one knows in knowing that one thing made another thing happen. 1.3 How is analytic philosophy different from non-analytic philosophy? John Stuart Mill (1806–1873), the great philosopher and economist, said that he was an expert in but one science, that being the science of science. What he meant was obviously similar to what we’ve been saying, and it was similar to what the great philosopher and mathematical logician Gottlob Frege (1848–1925) meant when he said that logic studies not the laws of nature but the “laws of the laws of nature.” Whether Frege was right depends on what exactly one means by “logic.” But if by “logic” he meant “philosophy,” then Frege’s dictum was spot-on. Frege is often described as the first analytic philosopher. Michael Dummett (1925–), an exceptionally capable contemporary philosopher of language, said that “analytic philosophy is post-Fregean philosophy.” What does Dummett mean? With some exceptions, pre-Fregean philosophers thought they were studying the most general features of the actual world. They thought that, like the botanist, they were in the business of saying how the world is, the only difference between their work and the botanist’s being that theirs is concerned with more general features of reality than the botanist’s. Frege showed that this is wrong. Any interest that botanists have in plants that might exist, but don’t, is subordinate to their interest in what plants actually exist. Like all scientists, they are interested in what there could be only to the extent that it helps them figure out what there is. But with philosophers, it’s the other way around. Any interest they have in the actual is subordinate to their interest in the possible. Unlike non-analytic philosophers, analytic philosophers do figure out what there could be by analyzing statements. Statements that make sense are those that can be true, and statements that don’t are those that can’t. Therefore, statements that make sense describe...",

    "text": "Analytic philosophy is philosophy that is driven by acceptance of FL. Let us now expand on FL and make it clear why it is true. 2.1 The wrong way to react to grammatical surface-structure In respect of its grammatical form: (JS) “John smokes” is comparable to: (MS) “Mary smokes.” JS attributes the property of being a smoker to John; MS attributes that property to Mary. In respect of its grammatical form, each of JS and MS is comparable to: (LJ) “Larry juggles” and also to: (JJ) “Jane jogs.” Each of these sentences says of some individual that he or she has a certain property. The obvious inference to make is that any sentence grammatically comparable to any one of these four sentences says of some individual that he or she (or it) has some property. In light of these points, consider the sentence: (SS) Someone smokes. Given what we just said, the obvious thing to say about it is that it attributes the property of smoking to some individual. But which individual could that be? Which individual does “someone” pick out? “It picks out an ambiguous person,” said one logician.[28] But this answer is no good. Words are ambiguous, not people. “Bank” is ambiguous, since it has two meanings. But I’m not ambiguous, and neither are you. And if per impossibile there did exist some ambiguous person—some blank, featureless shell of a person who was picked out by “someone”—SS would unambiguously say of that person that he or she smoked. But there clearly isn’t any one person to whom SS attributes the property of smoking. This is easily shown.[29] If Smith smokes, the sentence: “someone smokes but Smith does not” will be false. But it won’t be self-contradictory; it won’t be like “Smith smokes but Smith does not smoke.” (For a statement to be self-contradictory is for it to bear two mutually opposed meanings.) Of course, there isn’t anything special about the name “Smith,” what we just said could have been said in connection with Jones or Brown or any other expression that refers to some individual. Thus, there is no individual N such that it is self-contradictory to say that someone smokes but N does not. Therefore “someone” doesn’t refer to anyone. “But you’ve misunderstood my thesis” it will be said. “The word “someone” doesn’t unambiguously pick out an ambiguous person. It is itself ambiguous. It refers to Fred...",

    "text": "Most reasonable people would accept most of these principles, if not all of them. But there can be no observation-based or, therefore, experimentation-based way of determining whether or not any given one of these given principles is false. Consider the principle that the testimony of the senses can generally be trusted.[36] Though integral to scientific and everyday practice, observations couldn’t possibly verify it. After all, no observation is to be trusted until the truth of (i) has been established. What about by asking others what their sense-perceptions were? That would be to no avail. First of all, it is only through your own sense-perceptions that you have any knowledge of what sense-perceptions others are having. So unless your own senses can be trusted, you can’t trust other people’s testimony as to what their senses are. In fact, to continue further in this same vein, unless you assume the truth of (i), you cannot coherently assume that there exist other people. Nor, therefore, can you assume that, if there are other people, those people, when speaking to you, are being either honest or truthful. 3.1.2 A historical aside: Wittgenstein's blunder Incidentally, the preceding remarks make it clear why one of the most famous philosophical arguments of all time is a failure. Ludwig Wittgenstein argued that one must know what others say and do in order to know what one is oneself thinking. He argued, for reasons that we will examine in Chapter 5, that one is to trust one’s own views as to what one is thinking, feeling, etc., only if those views have been seconded by other members of the community of which one is a part. The flaw in this argument is obvious. If I can’t trust my senses, I have no way of knowing what you believe to be going on in my mind. If my senses can’t be trusted, I don’t even know that you exist, let alone that you have these or those views concerning my mental contents. So Wittgenstein’s position is rank absurdity. Let us now examine (iv). This contention is notoriously hard to justify. We know nothing about the future unless we know the laws that connect the present to the future. (If I know that the vase will shatter, it’s because I know (i) that the vase is about to collide with a hard surface and (ii) that, the laws of nature being...",

What isn’t agreed is whether the thing that it’s agreed to mean is true. But the controversies surrounding NS do concern language; they concern the semantics of the word “nothing.” Those who see “nothing” as being a referring term, like “Socrates,” see NS as saying that some featureless entity smokes. Those who deny that “nothing” and “Socrates” belong to the same semantic category don’t see NS as saying this. Therein lies the controversy. Nothing comparable to this holds in connection with JK. Analytic philosophers do agree that the right way to figure out whether or not JK is correct is by carefully analyzing its meaning. But they also hold that it isn’t to be solved through linguistic analysis. They're right on both counts. It must be emphasized that, according to analytic epistemologists, this puzzle is of a logical, not an empirical, nature. It is to be resolved through statement-analysis alone, not through statement-analysis combined with empirical research. They’re clearly right about this. JK says that John’s knowing that 1 + 1 = 2 is inconsistent with his not being on the receiving end of a causal process initiated by that fact. For P to be inconsistent with Q is for it to be impossible for both P and Q to be true. What doesn’t exist cannot be observed. A fortiori what cannot exist cannot be observed. Thus, observation cannot tell you that anything is inconsistent with anything. So there is no way for it to tell you whether JK is correct.[51]",

It does this by saying exactly what it is that is ruled out by a given thing’s falling into a given category—by, for example, a given thing’s being an instance of knowledge. Since observation can’t tell one whether one statement is inconsistent with another, philosophical assertions are non-empirical. W.V.O. Quine is the only philosopher I know to hold that epistemological disputes are not to be settled by analyzing concepts. In his paper “Epistemology Naturalized,” Quine said that epistemological questions are not to be answered in this way, and are to be answered in the same way as scientific questions; e.g., “what is the Moon’s chemical composition?” There are two points to make here. First of all, even though Quine was an analytic philosopher by trade, it doesn’t follow that all of his views were those of an analytic philosopher; and in this context, I would suggest, he was not being an analytic philosopher. He was being an opponent of analytic philosophy. Second, Quine’s view is incoherent. Natural science is based on empirical observation. Empirical observation cannot tell you that it itself is a source of knowledge. Therefore, it cannot be known through natural science that observation is a source of knowledge, and it must therefore be known in some non-empirical, and therefore non-scientific, manner.

    "text": "A sentence is true or false depending on whether it has a true or false proposition for its meaning. Thus, when a sentence is described as “true,” the property being attributed to it isn’t the same as the property that is attributed to a proposition that is so described. For a sentence to be “true” is for it to encode a true proposition. But this isn’t what it is for a proposition to be true, since propositions don’t encode anything. In Chapter 3, we’ll say what exactly it is for a proposition to be true. But the obvious answer, though imprecise, is the right one; namely, for a proposition to be true is for it to fit the facts. The term “statement” is ambiguous; it has three distinct meanings. Sometimes it refers to propositions, sometimes it refers to the sentences used to affirm them, and sometimes it refers to the act of using a sentence to affirm a proposition. Wittgenstein didn’t countenance the existence of propositions, and this obviously had a hand in his erroneously believing that philosophy is the analysis of sentences, when the truth is that philosophy is the analysis of propositions. Even Frege’s analyses of sentences such as “someone snores” and “nothing is a square circle” fail to conform to Wittgenstein’s conception of what philosophy is supposed to do, since, as we’ll see in a moment, they’re analyses of propositions that involve analyses of sentences and therefore are not themselves analyses of sentences. One must know at least some English to understand the sentence: (1) “John knows that 1 + 1 = 2.” But the proposition meant by that sentence can be grasped without speaking English; and one needn’t know English, or any other given language, to be able to analyze that proposition correctly. But analyzing (1)—the sentence, not the corresponding proposition—does involve such knowledge. A sentence is an expression; it consists of nouns, verbs, etc. Analyzing (1) involves knowing the various grammatical nuances involved in its structure. Analyzing the corresponding proposition has nothing to do with anything relating to grammar or any other aspect of language. No such knowledge is needed to analyze the corresponding proposition. Even though Frege’s work inspired many to identify philosophy with sentence-analysis, Frege himself always made it very clear that propositions are not sentences and that although sentences are human creations, their meanings are not.[53]",

    "text": "But Frege’s work had a profound influence on philosophers who were working in areas that have no direct connection to language or logic. Frege showed that, by thinking clearly, systematically, and self-critically, one could make real headway on philosophical problems in which others had yet to make so much as a dent, despite hundreds of years of trying. “The devil is in the details,” as they say. Pre-Fregean philosophers tended to disregard the details. Frege did not. He was a stickler for them. And it was partly, though obviously not entirely, for this reason that he was able to solve problems that his predecessors could not. The word “analytic philosopher” sometimes refers to the sort of philosophy done by people who aspire to approach philosophical problems in the same careful and clear-headed way as Frege. Thus, there are analytic philosophers of law, analytic ethicists, analytic philosophers of religion, etc. What makes them analytic philosophers isn’t that they’re talking about language or logic or any of the things that Frege talked about. It’s that they believe the problems they’re concerned with can be solved in the same coolheaded, logical way that Frege solved problems relating to language and logic. But even when taken in the narrow sense, “analytic philosophy” (i.e., philosophical logic/the philosophy of language) is only misleadingly described as the analysis of sentences. Philosophers of language are interested in the sentence: (NS) “Nothing is a square circle,” only to the extent that by understanding it they will deepen their insight into concepts of a general kind (e.g., meaning, analytic truth, modality). Linguists, on the other hand, are interested in those concepts only to the extent that an understanding of them will help them understand specific sentences, such as NS. Frege did indeed painstakingly analyze specific sentences. But he did so only because he knew that, by so doing, he could identify general logical principles. Thus, for Frege, his insight that logical and grammatical form pull apart was ultimately just a means to an end, the end being the identification of the actual nature of the bearing-relations that propositions have with respect to one another. So, yes, analytic philosophy is statement-analysis; and, yes, it was Frege’s brilliant analyses of sentences that availed philosophers of the principles needed to analyze statements properly. But analytic philosophy, even the narrow sense of the term, is not itself sentential analysis.",

As we’ve seen, no noise constitutes a sentence-utterance unless it embodies an intention of a certain kind; and there is no linguistic behavior of any kind where people aren’t intentionally following what they believe to be existing semantic rules. Some believe that semantic rules are conventions. Others believe that they are functions (in the mathematical sense)— assignments of meanings or truth-conditions to noises or to properties that are instantiated by noises (or ink marks, etc.). There is no way to figure out what semantic rules are without examining these concepts. And even if these questions are side-stepped, and philosophers focus only on narrowly semantic concepts (e.g., reference, compositionality, etc.), philosophy ends up being the analysis, not of sentences, but of concepts. Thus, the thesis that philosophy is the study of sentences either collapses into the obviously false thesis that philosophy is the empirical study of language or into the thesis that philosophy is conceptual analysis (i.e., the analysis of the concepts in terms of which the world is understood). Thus, Wittgenstein’s contention that philosophy is the study of sentences collapses into the very view to which it is meant to be an alternative (viz., that philosophy is the analysis of concepts, as opposed to expressions), and is therefore false.

    "text": "What Wittgenstein is saying isn’t confined to the defensible claim that philosophical problems are to be solved by clarifying statements. Wittgenstein is making two additional claims. First, no sentence that appears to make a philosophical statement means anything. Second, it’s only because they’re syntactically ill-formed that such sentences are meaningless—there is no other reason. Let us evaluate these claims. Though ungrammatical, the sentence: (MH) “Me and Herby play tennis every day, and me always win because Herby not in good shape,” is perfectly meaningful. Ungrammatical statements are often meaningful. Thus, BG’s failure to mean anything cannot be entirely blamed on its being ungrammatical. What’s the real problem with BG? The expression “more identical than” is obviously supposed to function in the same way as relational expressions, like “more important than” or “identical with.” But there is no relation that it picks out. Though it consists of English expressions, the expression “more identical than” is itself no more a part of the English lexicon than “blurga derba gurb.” For that reason, the meaninglessness of BG is to be accounted for in the same way as the meaninglessness of: (BG#) “The beautiful is blurga derba gurb the good.” The problem with BG# is that “blurga derba gurb” doesn’t mean anything. It may be that its meaninglessness is reflected in its syntax. It may be that because “blurga derba gurb” doesn’t mean anything, BG#’s syntax is off. But, if so, its syntactic shortcomings are to be explained in terms of its lack of meaning, not vice versa. The same holds of BG. The reason that BG doesn’t mean anything is that “more identical than” doesn’t mean anything. BG’s syntactic shortcomings are to be explained in terms of its lack of meaning, and not vice versa. This is easily verified. Given any relation R, if “more identical than” denoted R, BG would be meaningful. If, for example, it denoted the relation that is in fact picked out by the expression “a better dancer than,” BG would say that the good is a better dancer than the beautiful; and it would thus have the same meaning as: (BG*) “The property of goodness is a better dancer than the property of being beautiful.” BG* isn’t meaningless; it’s false. The property of goodness can’t dance; neither can any other property, including the property of being beautiful. Therefore, the former property isn’t a better dancer than the latter....",

    "text": "Given how implausible and illogical it is, why on Earth did Wittgenstein hold that philosophical statements are always ungrammatical nonsense? The answer, I believe, is that Wittgenstein thought this view to be the distillation of Frege’s groundbreaking philosophical successes. Frege showed that reparsing sentences sometimes solves philosophical problems. By reparsing: (NS) “Nothing is a square circle,” we show that it doesn’t attribute the property of being a square circle to some non-entity, thereby dissolving an age-old riddle. Wittgenstein seems to have inferred from these successes of Frege’s that all philosophical problems are to be solved by reparsing sentences. This inference is fallacious. Given only that some philosophical problems are to be solved by reparsing sentences, it doesn’t follow that they are all to be solved in that way. And we’ve seen that, indeed, many of them are not to be solved in that way. Also, there were no cases where Frege’s reparsing of a problematic sentence showed it to be ill-formed. For example, in reparsing NS, Frege showed that its logical syntax differed from its apparent syntax. He didn’t show that there was anything wrong with its logical syntax. To be sure, philosophers often produce deeply absurd statements. For example, according to pre-Fregean philosophers, NS entails that: (NS1) There exists some non-entity that is a square circle. If NS1 is right: (NS2) There exists some entity that does not exist that is a square and a circle. NS2 is self-contradictory and therefore absurd. But it’s obviously meaningful. If it weren’t, it wouldn’t contradict itself. (For a sentence to contradict itself is for it to bear two opposed meanings. “Smith is a lawyer and Smith is not a lawyer” because the one conjunct[72] contradicts the other.) But whereas this sentence is explicitly self-contradictory, the self-contradictory sentences that people actually utter are usually only implicitly so. But supposing for argument’s sake that philosophical statements are meaningless, it isn’t because they’re ungrammatical that they’re meaningless. Second, they’re not meaningless. The statement that they’re meaningless is itself a philosophical statement. That statement is therefore false if it’s true. Therefore it is false. (Any statement that entails its own negation is false.)",

    "text": "Falsificationism is false. Though obviously meaningful, the statement “there exists a gold ball that weighs exactly 27.13654 lbs.” cannot be conclusively falsified, since no matter how many gold balls you consider it is possible that some gold ball that you haven’t considered has that weight. Falsificationism is really a version of verificationism. According to verificationism, S is meaningful if verifiable. According to falsificationism, S is meaningful if S’s negation is verifiable. So given that verificationism fails, it’s no surprise that falsificationism does as well. In light of the failure of falsificationism, advocates of LP decided to soften their views about meaningfulness one more time. This time, they said that a non-tautologous statement is meaningful if possible observations can confirm it. (P confirms Q if, other things being equal, Q is more likely to be true if P is true than if not-P is true. Other things being equal, Smith is more likely to be wealthy if he wears fancy clothes than if he doesn’t wear fancy clothes. Thus, “Smith wears fancy clothes” confirms “Smith is wealthy.”) We’ll refer to this view as “confirmationalism.” Confirmationalism is equivalent with the position that all meaningful non-tautologous statements are empirical. An empirical statement is one that, if true, expresses a truth that must be known through observation and that, if false, is the negation of a true empirical statement. “There are trees in Santa Barbara, CA” is a true empirical statement, and “there are no trees in Santa Barbara, CA” is a false one. The negation of an empirical statement is an empirical statement. This is because, if it’s an empirical question whether or not S is true, then it’s an empirical question whether or not S is false, and therefore whether or not not-S is true. (As we will see, there are very few truths, if any, that can be known strictly through observation. A statement is empirical if the truth or falsity of it is to be decided on grounds that are at least partly observational.) Henceforth when we refer to “logical positivism” (LP), we will refer to the position that a statement S is meaningful if and only if (i) S is a tautology (e.g., “sisters are female siblings”) or (ii) S is an empirical statement (e.g., “there are trees in Santa Barbara”).[79]",

But (3) clearly isn’t a conventional truth. Though it follows from conventions, (3) is not itself a convention. (3) is thus a non-tautologous, non-empirical truth. It follows that LP is false. It’s possible to have conventions that are inconsistent with one another. (Two statements are inconsistent with each other if it is logically impossible for them both to be true. Thus, “Smith has three cars” is inconsistent with “Smith has no cars.”) If I stipulate that “x” unambiguously refers to the number two, and I also stipulate that “x” refers to the number of sides of a triangle, my definitions are inconsistent with one another. The internal consistency of conventions is not itself a matter of convention. It isn’t an empirical fact that the conventions just described are inconsistent with each other. To say that P is inconsistent with Q is to say that P must be false if Q is true. Observation cannot tell you what must be the case; it can tell you, at most, what is the case. So it cannot tell you that two linguistic conventions are inconsistent with each other. Since observation cannot tell you whether or not two statements are inconsistent with each other, it cannot tell you whether or not one statement is a necessary consequence of some other. This is because for Q to be a necessary consequence of P is for P to be inconsistent with the negation of Q.

Another immediate consequence is that what it is for those two sentences to have the same meaning is not for them to be “used in the same way.” Also, given any natural language, there are infinitely many sentences belonging to it that have never been used. The thesis that sentences have the same meaning iff they’re used in the same way has the absurd consequence that any two sentences that haven’t been used before have the same meaning.

LP says that any meaningful statement is either a tautology or is empirical. So if LP is correct, it is itself either a tautology or it is empirical. It isn’t a matter of convention that the expression “meaningful sentence” is interchangeable with the expression “sentence that is either a tautology or is empirical.” Therefore, LP isn’t a tautology. Since it isn’t a tautology, LP is an empirical truth if it isn’t false. (A similar argument: LP is a theory. It is a theory concerning the conditions sentences must satisfy to be meaningful. Tautologies aren’t theories. Tautologies are conventions. Conventions aren’t theories. Therefore, LP isn’t a tautology.) But LP isn’t an empirical truth. Any attempt to provide an observational basis for any statement presupposes the meaningfulness of that statement and thus presupposes an answer to the question “what conditions must a statement fulfill to be meaningful?” For this reason, the question “what conditions must a statement satisfy if it is to be meaningful?” isn’t empirical in nature. It follows that one cannot coherently attempt to find empirical grounds for accepting LP, since any attempt to do so itself presupposes the meaningfulness of LP. Thus, LP isn’t an empirical theory. Thus, LP is neither an empirical truth nor a tautology. It is thus a counterexample to itself and is therefore false. Interestingly, in the TLP, Wittgenstein seems to be aware that one cannot coherently say that there can be non-tautologous meaningful statements. Not a single one of the assertions in the TLP is empirical; and not a single one of them is a tautology. This means that, if the TLP's main thesis is correct, the TLP is nonsense. Wittgenstein acknowledges this. For he ends his book by saying that every point that he has made is meaningless and, consequently, that not a single one of them is true. But, Wittgenstein says, those enable one to see the truth, even though they are not themselves true. These non-truths, Wittgenstein says, are like ladders that help one get to the truth.

So Wittgenstein’s words, if understood, have a meaning, and Wittgenstein is therefore contradicting himself in saying that those who understand his words will see that they’re meaningless. Wittgenstein’s awe-inspiring injunction that we pass over in silence what we can’t speak about involves a similar solecism. To remain silent about something is to pass over it in silence. So Wittgenstein is asking, emptily, that we not say anything about what we can’t possibly say anything about. 4.7.1 Empiricism self-refuting These points are easily extended to show that empiricism is false if it’s true and, therefore, that it’s false. Empiricism isn’t the claim that: (1) Whatever we know now, we learned it through sense­perception—but it’s possible that at some time in the future we’ll acquire knowledge in some other way. Empiricism is the doctrine that everything that 2) It’s inherent in the nature of knowledge that all knowledge be strictly observation-based. But it cannot be known through observation that (2) is correct. According to (2), ‹x is knowledge› is inconsistent with ‹x isn’t known through observation.› But, as we noted on page 24, observation cannot tell you whether one statement is consistent with some other statement. Thus, any body of observational data is consistent with the assumption that empiricism is false. This means that there cannot be strictly observational grounds for believing empiricism correct. Thus, so far as empiricism is correct, there are no grounds for believing it correct; and so far as there are such grounds, empiricism is false. Thus, the likelihood that empiricism is correct is inversely proportional to the degree of probability that the information at our disposal confers on it. And this means that if it’s a certainty that empiricism is correct, it’s a certainty that it’s false. Therefore, empiricism, if true, is false; therefore it’s false.",

In observing the paper-weight on my desk, I’m not observing some effect of the stone upon myself: I’m observing the stone itself.[92] To be sure, my observing the stone is itself an effect of some event involving the stone. (Light bounces off the stone and, in due course, strikes my retinas, precipitating various physiological and psychological responses, among them the aforementioned sense-perception.) But that doesn’t mean that what I’m seeing, in having that sense-perception, is some effect that the stone had on me; and unless we’re perpetually hallucinating, in which case we’re never observing anything external, we very obviously do observe external objects. This brings us to the second problem with Russell’s argument. Russell says that the greenness, hardness, and coldness of daily observation are not identical with their counterparts in physics. This is false. Physics has a lot to say about greenness, hardness, and coldness that commonsense does not. But that’s very different from saying that the coldness we feel, the greenness we see, etc., aren’t the greenness, coldness, and hardness of physics. Physics tells us what it is for something to have the properties we know them to have through sight, touch, etc. When you grab an object and feel that it’s cold, you don’t feel or otherwise sense-perceive the micro-events in virtue of which it is cold. (More precisely, when you grab an object and feel that it’s cold, its coldness is not thereby presented to you as consisting of the micro-events of which it does, in fact, consist.) It is the job of the theoretical physicist to tell you about these micro-events. This means that the coldness studied by the physicist is identical with the coldness that you feel. Physics tells us that many of our pre-theoretic beliefs as to what that coldness is are wrong; and in order to do that, it has to study the coldness that those pre-theoretic beliefs concern. So Russell’s argument, despite Einstein’s high regard for it, is a failure.[93]",

In general, its internal structure is irrelevant. Considered as an expression of L, it has no internal structure. (It is what philosophers of language call a semantic primitive. A “semantic primitive,” or “primitive symbol,” is one that doesn’t consist of other symbols and that, so far as it is an expression of a language, thus has no internal structure.) For exactly similar reasons, each of the other photographs composing L is, when considered as an expression of L, devoid of internal structure and thus, in the most extreme way possible, not like a graphic representation. We must make one more point before we can close the argument. Let N be a photograph of a bolt of lightning, and suppose that N is the L-translation of the English expression “it is not the case that.” So if S is the L-translation of “grass is green,” NS is the L-translation of “grass is not green.” (NS is formed by putting N to the left of S.) Even though NS consists of pictures, it is not itself a picture. Putting two pictures together isn’t one picture; it’s just two pictures that are next to each other. For exactly similar reasons, if conventions were created whereby the sentences of L could be conjoined, disjoined,[102] or otherwise combined, the resulting compound sentences would not be pictures. Let us take stock. Not a single one of the simple symbols belonging to L is a graphic representation of the fact that it depicts, and not a single one of the complex symbols belonging to L is a graphic representation of the fact depicted by any one of its components. In general, to the extent that a given thing is functioning as a linguistic expression, it is not functioning as a picture. Things that happen to be pictures cannot function as pictures so far as they are functioning as linguistic expressions or, therefore, as sentences. Thus, Wittgenstein's contention that sentences are pictures of the facts they describe is the antithesis of the truth. In addition to showing that Wittgenstein’s picture-theory is false, this shows that any conventional assignment of meaning to any collection of symbols—any language, in other words—necessarily yields symbols that have a unique decomposition into discrete parts.

To identify the logical form of a statement is simply to make it clear what it means. We can do this. We do it all the time. We do it whenever we put the meanings of words into words. There are some qualifications to this, as we’ll see in a moment, but none that redound to the credit of Wittgenstein’s point. Wittgenstein’s assertion that “what can be shown, cannot be said” is obviously false. I tell you that I can do fifty push-ups. (I say “I can do fifty push-ups.”) You don’t believe me. So I show you that I can do fifty push-ups. (I do fifty push-ups in front of you.) And, as we just saw, that principle holds no less in connection with logical forms than in connection with a person’s ability to do push-ups. Echoing what we said earlier, although it isn’t clear why Wittgenstein made these claims or what he meant by them, it is clear that they are consistent with his view that sentences are pictures of reality. A picture cannot picture itself. If P is a picture of a seagull, P can’t contain a picture of itself, for the simple reason that nothing can be a proper part of itself. Of course, P might be a picture of a big seagull and also of some other, much littler, but otherwise identical seagull. But the big-seagull part of the picture isn’t identical with the little-seagull part. The big part contains two seagull-images; the little part only contains one. So if sentences were pictures, then a given sentence S1 couldn’t be a picture of itself. But it doesn’t follow that some other picture S2 couldn’t be a picture of S1. Nor, therefore, does Wittgenstein’s much stronger claim that nothing—no picture, no set of pictures, no sentence—could depict or otherwise represent the rules by which true statements are paired off with the facts they described. Wittgenstein’s claim that we cannot state the logical forms of sentences, which collapses into the brazenly false claim that we can never say what our words mean, has two roots. One of them is his just-discussed belief that sentences are pictures of the facts they describe. The other is his not yet discussed belief that if it’s assumed that we can say what our...",

And if per impossibile there did exist a logically perfect language, it would be expressively inferior to English, Arabic, and every other natural language. In other words, there would be much that couldn’t be said in it that could be said in any natural language. More precisely, for each analytic truth capable of being expressed by a logically perfect language, there would be infinitely many more that it could not express and that English or Spanish or any other natural language could express. At the same time, there would be no truth that could be expressed in a logically perfectly language that couldn’t also be expressed in a logically imperfect language, such as English. Let us now discuss why this is so. A sentence belonging to a logically perfect language is analytically true iff it is formally true. Why is this? A sentence is perspicuous only to the extent that its grammatical form makes it clear what it says and, therefore, makes it clear what it entails and what entails it. Bearing this in mind, let S be some arbitrary sentence. To the extent that there are false sentences, or true but non-analytic sentences, that have the same surface-structure as S, S’s grammatical and logical forms don’t coalesce and, consequently, S isn’t perspicuous. So an analytically true sentence is perspicuous only if all other sentences having the same form are true. A sentence is formally true if, and only if, any sentence having the same form is true. Thus, a sentence is perspicuous only if formally true. Therefore, a sentence belonging to a logically perfect language is analytic only if it is formally true.[110]",

Given any object x and any property phi, the sentence (S1) \"‹if x has phi, then it is not the case that x does not have phi›,\" is perspicuous, the reason being that nothing having the same surface structure is false. But the superficially similar sentence: (S2) “‹given any object x and any property phi, if x has phi, then x does not have phi›,” is not perspicuous, since it has the same surface structure as: (S3) “‹given no object x and no property phi, if x has phi, then x does not have phi›,” which is false. Formally true sentences are instances of informally true universal generalizations. So no sentence capable of expressing such generalizations is logically perfect. This point has important and often overlooked consequences. Making a valid deductive inference involves recognizing an entailment. Your deductively inferring Q from P involves your recognizing that P entails Q. The only way to know that some formal entailment is valid is to know that some informal entailment is valid. You know that: (S4) “Jerry is in Richmond,” entails that: (S5) “it’s not the case Jerry is not in Richmond.” And that’s why, if you accept S4, you also accept S5. But how do you know that S4 entails S5? Is it on the basis of your knowledge that all instances of S1 are true? No. How could you possibly know that all of S1’ s instances were true unless you could recognize the validity of specific inferences that it licenses (such as the inference from S4 to S5)? If you couldn’t recognize that S4 entailed S5, then you obviously wouldn’t have any idea why all of S1’s instances were correct. This point is a psychological corollary of an epistemological point, which, in its turn, is a corollary of a logical point. The reason why every instance of S1 is true—in other words, the reasonwhy S2 is true—is that each of infinitely many specific inferences, of which the inference from S4 entails S5 is but a single instance, is valid. There are, quite literally, infinitely many informally valid inferences for each formally valid one.

So, just as the Platonist holds, “red” and “smart” pick out entities of some sort or other. To use the objector’s own (Medieval) terminology, those expressions are “categorematic,” not “syncategorematic.” When we make it clear just what these terms mean, it becomes clear that the objector’s argument not only fails, but fails relative to its own assumptions. A syncategorematic entity is one whose function is to form complex expressions out of other expressions. Thus “and” is a syncategorematic entity since it enables complex expressions (“snow is white and grass is green”) to be formed out of other expressions (“snow is white”,” “grass is green”). “Of” is a syncategorematic expression for the same reason: given the expressions “picture” and “Paul”, “of” yields the complex expression “picture of Paul.” Bearing this in mind, consider the sentence: (4) “snow is white and grass is green.” Although “and” serves a purely “syntactic” function, it does so, at least in part, by way of picking out a certain (Platonic) entity. This is because (4) entails: (5) There is some relation R such that the proposition that snow is white bears R with respect to the proposition that grass is green (and vice versa). What we said about the occurrence of “and” in (4) is true of the occurrence of “of” in: (6) There is a picture of Paul on the mantelpiece. This is because (6) entails that: (7) There is some relation R such that there is a picture on the mantelpiece that bears R with respect to Paul. So even syncategorematic items sometimes have referents. Therefore, even if “red” and other predicates were syncategorematic, it wouldn’t follow that predicates didn’t have referents. Gottlob Frege (1944-1925) put forth the following (italicized) argument, which some authors have taken to show that predicates don’t refer to anything and, therefore, don’t refer to properties (“NP” is short for “No Properties”). (NP) The expression “the property of whiteness” refers to the property of whiteness, at least if anything so refers. So if the occurrence of “white” in: (8) “snow is white”, referred to that property, then (8) would have the meaning as: (9) “snow, the property of whiteness.” But (8) is meaningful, whereas (9) is meaningless; so they don’t have the same meaning.

But, in and of themselves, those photonic disturbances are lifeless and informationally empty. If they were to hit a rock, vision wouldn’t result. The photons responsible for those disturbances don’t contain little dog images. You have to read such information into them. Your mind must extract such images from them; and to do this, your mind must have some way of interpreting those disturbances. The knowledge needed to interpret these disturbances cannot come from sense-perception, since that knowledge is itself a prerequisite for sense-perception. This entails that, in at least some cases, it isn’t through a causal process that the knower becomes aware of the known. It also entails that a prerequisite for the very existence of sense-perceptions, or indeed of any mental activity that results from causal exchanges with the world, is knowledge of properties. Why does it entail this? Because, were it not for a grasp of what it is for a thing to have the property of having this or that shape (or this or that color or this or that location, etc.), one couldn’t interpret the radiation-induced disturbances of one’s sensory receptors in the way needed to generate sense-perceptions. 2.6. Argument #6: Conceptualism If they exist, properties are identical with mental representations of some kind or other—presumably, with thoughts about rocks or, in any case, with categories created by the mind that help it upload and process sensory information.[128]",

    "text": "This argument evaluated: Since conventionalism is evaluated in Chapters 1 and 9, we can be brief.[131] Not all non-empirical truths are conventions. It’s a non-empirical truth that there are continuous functions that cannot be differentiated at any point. But it’s not a convention. Given the symbolic conventions that govern our usage of the relevant words (“continuous,” “function,” “differentiated,” etc.), it follows that the sentence “there are continuous functions that cannot be differentiated at any point” expresses a truth. But this means that it holds in virtue of convention plus some various non-conventional facts. Those facts are not empirical; they don’t concern the spatiotemporal world. Therefore, the fact described by that sentence is not spatiotemporal. Further, since that fact concerns logical structures of properties (e.g., the property of being differentiable), it follows that there are properties. Since, as we just noted, that fact is non-spatiotemporal, it follows that properties are non-spatiotemporal. 3.0 Nominalism Many medieval philosophers, and some 20th century philosophers, held that properties are identical with words and, therefore, that properties are not spatiotemporal. But this position is incoherent, since words and linguistic expressions generally are themselves universals or properties. How many words are right below this sentence? “snow” “snow” “snow” Is it one or three? The answer: there are three instances of one word. To put it another way, there are three tokens of one word-type.[132] Instances of an expression are expression-tokens and the expressions themselves are expression-types. No one utterance of the word “snow” is identical with that word. It’s not as though the word-type “snow” will disappear when the inscriptions of it in the lines above this are destroyed. That word-type is a property of certain deposits of ink (e.g., the ones above) and bursts of noise, and those ink-deposits and bursts of noise are therefore instances of that property. This shows that, even if the nominalist is right to identify the property of being a rock with the word “rock,” he has still conceded the truth of Platonism. Plus, that property isn’t identical with that word. The Spanish word for rock is “piedra.” It would be arbitrary to identify that property with the word “rock” but not with the word “piedra.” Since “rock” and “piedra” are obviously different words, the nominalist must say that the property of being a rock is not identical with itself, which is absurd.

Smith’s violent lung infection is a cause of Smith’s hacking cough. But for x to be evidence of y, it is neither necessary nor sufficient that y cause x. Why isn’t it necessary? First of all, causes can be evidence of their own effects. (Bill’s current drunkenness is evidence of a poor performance on his upcoming economics exam.) Second, if some event or state of affairs z is a cause of both x and y, then x can be evidence of y without being a cause or an effect of y. (Suppose that Bill is slurring his words. This is evidence that he’ll do poorly on the upcoming test. But his slurring his words is neither a cause, nor an effect, of his substandard test-performance. His drunkenness is a cause of (a) his slurred speech and (b) his imminent, substandard test-performance. And it’s because his slurred speech has a causal ancestor in common with his poor test-performance that the former is evidence of the latter.) Why isn’t it sufficient? Given only that the cause of Bill’s failing was that he was drunk, we can’t infer from the fact that he failed that he was drunk. There are many reasons why a person may fail a test. Supposing that y caused x to occur, x is evidence of y only if it can’t reasonably be supposed that anything other than y was the cause.

    "text": "Meaning #3: The linguistic meaning of “meaning” The sentence “snow is white” says something about something; it attributes the property of being white to snow. Therefore, it means that snow is white. This kind of meaning is in a class by itself; it isn’t identical with either of the two kinds mentioned so far; and there isn’t any obvious way to understand it in terms of them. Let us now say why. Meaning in the psychological sense involves, but does not coincide with, meaning in the linguistic sense. Once again suppose that, in response to your telling me that Sally is a wonderful person, I say “things aren’t always as they seem.” My meaning—what I’m trying to get across—is that Sally is devious. But in my attempt to get this across, I’m taking advantage of the fact that “things aren’t always as they seem” has an existing (linguistic) meaning. My meaning that Sally is devious is parasitic on my utterance’s meaning that things aren’t always as they seem. Meaning in the psychological sense is therefore parasitic on meaning in the linguistic sense. 1.2 Why meaning #3 . meaning #2 Some philosophers and linguists have held that for: (1) “Snow is white,” to mean that snow is white is for it to be the case that, in uttering “snow is white,” what people mean is that snow is white.

There are many sentences that have determinate meanings even though they’ve never been uttered before and, therefore, no one as of yet has ever meant anything by them. The sentence: (2) “The cube root of three is Sir Lawrence Olivier’s favorite irrational number between one and four,” has a determinate meaning, and it had a determinate meaning before any part of this book was written, even though, we may reasonably suppose, it had never previously been uttered or otherwise tokened. Thus, meaning in the linguistic sense is not in all cases identical with meaning in the psychological sense. But a stronger point is warranted. Let’s say that P1 and P2 are the propositions meant by (1) and (2), respectively. In saying that (1) means P1 and that (2) means P2, we are not using the word “means” equivocally. Both occurrences of “means” in the last sentence denote the same relationship. Thus, the relationship that (1) bears to its meaning is the same as the relationship that (2) bears to its meaning. Given that, as we saw, (2)’s having P2 for its meaning isn’t identical with P2’s being what people mean in uttering (2), it follows that (1)’s having P1 for its meaning isn’t identical with P1’s being what people mean in uttering (1). Of course, what we just said about (1) and (2) can be said of any other sentence. So even if what people mean in uttering a given sentence happens to coincide with its literal meaning, what it is for sentence S to have proposition P for its literal meaning isn’t for people to mean P in uttering S. Psychological meaning presupposes linguistic meaning. What a person means when uttering a given sentence is a function of, among other things, his beliefs as to what that sentence already means. You must believe that “snow is white” means snow is white if, intending to speak sincerely and literally, you say “snow is white” with the intention of getting it across that snow is white. If you think that “snow is white” means grass is green, you cannot, if your intention is to speak sincerely and literally, believe that “snow is white” means snow is white. Of course, you could know full well what “snow is white” in fact means, but use that sentence to get across something that has nothing...",

If correct, that would have the consequence that one couldn’t possibly draw a false inference from any sentence. This in its turn would have the consequence that no sentence would mean anything. Which, since nothing meaningless is a sentence, would have the absurd consequence that there neither are, nor could be, sentences. Consider the sentence “Bill plagiarized his first novel.” If one knows that sentence to be true, one can make inferences about Bill’s character, his past activities, his ambitions, his values, and so on, that one couldn’t make if, other things being equal, one didn’t know that sentence to be true. But it’s only because of what the sentence already means that one can make those inferences. Given any other sentence, the same thing mutatis mutandis is true of it. CRS says that what a sentence means is determined by what we infer from it. Since it’s the other way around, as we’ve just seen, CRS is false. 6.0 What is literal meaning? Where complex expressions are concerned, there is no limit to how much literal and understood meaning may diverge from each other. But where simple expressions are concerned, literal and understood meaning must coalesce. It makes no sense to suppose that people could be systematically wrong as to what “red” meant. If people thought that “red” meant what is in fact meant by “blue,” then “red” would have that meaning. Systematic, widespread error is impossible where semantically simple expressions are concerned. This gives us a way of understanding what literal meaning is. Even though there can be widespread, systematic misinterpretations of sentences, those misinterpretations do not arise as a result of people failing to know what the simple parts of sentences mean. They arise as a result of people not knowing how to put those meanings together. So to the extent that its meaning is fixed by the fact that it has the form ‹...Socrates...›, people (English speakers) do systematically understand “Socrates was more wise than Plato, but he was less sharp then Aristotle”; and to the extent that its meaning was determined by its having the form ‹...wise...›, people do understand that sentence; and so on.

For example, an occurrence of the pronoun “I” has a referent, this being the person who uttered it, and it picks out that referent in a certain way (i.e., by way of a certain concept). Thus, the semantics of “I” is given by the rule that an utterance of “I” refers to a given person if and only if that person has the property of being the one that produced that utterance. So, if I say “I am tired,” the concept through which my utterance of “I” refers to me is the concept person who produced the utterance in question. This, then, is the concept through which reference is secured; it is, as we’ll henceforth put it, the mediating concept.[152] When Smith says “I am tired,” his utterance of “I” refers to himself, not to me. But the mediating concept remains the same. If somebody points to me and says “that guy is tall,” the person picked out by “that guy” is me. But in this case, the mediating-concept is different. The semantics rule for “that guy” is given by the rule that, if “that guy” is uttered in a context where there is a unique, salient guy, that utterance refers to that individual. “I” and “that guy” are context-sensitive expressions: What such an expression refers to depends in a systematic manner on facts about the context of utterance. (We’ll refine this vague statement shortly.) Such expressions are known as “indexicals.” Other examples of indexicals are “you,” “he,” “those animals,” “this monkey,” “tomorrow,” “yesterday.” Some indexicals are single words (e.g., “tomorrow,” “he”); others consist of more than one (e.g., “that tall man”). The latter are known as “complex indexicals.” 7.1.1 Demonstratives vs. indexicals Some indexicals often cannot be successfully used without an accompanying demonstration on the speaker’s part, the purpose of which is to eliminate any doubt as to what the intended referent is. If Jim and Larry are both equally salient in the context in question, an utterance of “that guy” won’t single anyone out. But it will do so if an act of pointing accompanies it. Indexicals that fall into this category are known as “demonstratives.” Not all indexicals are demonstratives. For example, “tomorrow,” “now,” and “here,” aren’t demonstratives. Given an utterance of “tomorrow,” no gesture is needed to make it clear what the intended referent is. If I...",

But even though an utterance in 2009 of “the U.S. President” doesn’t have the same referent as an utterance in 1999 of that same expression, both utterances are assigned their respective referents by the same semantic rule. The circumstances have changed—hence the change in referent—but the semantic rule has stayed the same. That rule is: if, at time t, x uniquely has the property of being a U.S. president, then an utterance at t of “the U.S. President” refers to x. 7.2.1 Incomplete definite descriptions Some definite descriptions appear to be “incomplete”—that is, they fail to pick out a single object. So, for example, “the bald guy” could pick out any one of many different people. But, like all expressions, definite descriptions are not used in a vacuum; and the context usually supplies the information needed to enrich the mediating concept enough to enable it to single out a single person. So if you and I are in a room and I say “the bald guy is wealthy,” it’s clear that, so far as I am making a determinate statement, what I mean is that the contextually salient bald guy is wealthy. If phi is a property that obviously has no more than one instance (e.g., the property of being the whole number successor of one or of being the U.S. President), phi’s sole instance is contextually salient by default.",

We saw this in Chapter 1, and we’ll see it again in Chapter 7 when we discuss Frege’s ground-breaking insights into arithmetical statements (e.g., “2 + 3 = 5”). Frege was the first to see clearly that logical and grammatical form may diverge—he was the first to grasp the very idea of such a divergence. This insight of his is embodied in his statement that the sentence: (WM) “Whales are mammals,” is not about whales. As paradoxical as it may seem, he was right. WM says that if an object is a whale, then it’s a mammal. But there is no specific object x such that WM says that x is a mammal. A fortiori there is no specific whale x such that WM says that x is a mammal; and for any number n, no matter how high, there are no whales x1....xn such that WM says that xi (1 = i = n) is a whale. So just as Frege said, WM isn’t about whales. WM makes a statement, not about whales, but about the property of being a whale. It says that: (WM*) the property of being a whale has the property of being instantiated only by mammals. WM* perspicuously represents WM’s meaning. In other words, WM* represents WM’s logical form. WM*’s grammatical form diverges from WM’s grammatical form. (For a statement to be “perspicuous” is for it to be clear in a logical, as opposed to a psychological, sense. The statement “if n is the number of Americans, and m is the number of cars collectively owned by American citizens, then n/m=2.2” makes it clear what is meant by “the average American citizen owns 2.2 cars” and is thus a perspicuous affirmation of the proposition meant by the latter. But the latter is probably psychologically easier to absorb than the former.)_ The reason that WM’s logical and grammatical forms pull apart is that WM contains a quantifier. (Examples of quantifiers are “all birds,” “no man,” “most whales,” “three birds,” and “some individuals.” We’ll define the term “quantifier” in a moment.) Given any statement of English, (or any other non-artificial language) that contains quantifiers, the logical and grammatical forms of that sentence diverge.

A mathematical function is a rule that assigns no more than one object to each object falling in a given class. (So “+1” can be thought of as expressing a function or rule that assigns 2 to 1, 3 to 2, etc.) According to Frege, the occurrence of “snores” in: (PS) “Plato snores,” is best represented as the open sentence ‹x snores›; and that open sentence is best thought of as expressing a function that assigns the truth-value true to each snorer and the truth-value false to each thing that doesn’t snore. (For brevity’s sake, I’ll henceforth use the words “truth” and “falsehood” instead of, respectively, “the truth-value true” and “the truth-value false.”) Here’s the idea. A true sentence results if the variable in ‹x is even› is replaced with an expression denoting an even number and false if it’s replaced with a number that doesn’t denote such a number. (“2 is even” is true and “3 is even” is false.) So we can think of ‹x is even› as assigning truth to two, four, etc., and falsity to one, three, etc. For similar reasons, we can see ‹x snores› as assigning truth to snorer Bob and falsehood to non-snorer Wilma, and so on. Frege sees the occurrence of “is taller than” in: (BTM) “Bill is taller than Mary,” as being identical with the open sentence ‹x is taller than y›, and he sees that open sentence as expressing a function that assigns truth-values to ordered pairs of objects. So ‹x is taller than y› assigns truth to the ordered pair <x, y> if x is taller than y and otherwise assigns falsehood to that pair. Frege treats: (BJMP) “Bill is standing between Mary and John,” as comprising the open-sentence ‹x is standing between y and z›; and he sees that open sentence as expressing a function that assigns truth to ordered triples of objects—as assigning that truth value to <Bill, Mary, John> just in case Bill is standing between Mary and John. In this way, Frege was able to assign a single form to all atomic sentences. An atomic sentence is one that, unlike “Bill is tall and...",

So, in a very clear sense of the term ‘combine,’ that property combines the property of smoking with (something individuative of) Tommy. (In the relevant sense of the term ‘combine,’ one property ‘combines’ n other properties exactly if the first is instantiated exactly if the other n properties are jointly instantiated.) And we know that, in some way or other, 1 combines (something individuative of) Tommy with the property of smoking. In at least one respect, then, C’s relationship to A and B is suggestively similar to 1’s relationship to its parts. Moreover, C ‘dominates’ each of A and B in a way suggestively similar to the way in which 1 dominates its constituents. A’s being instantiated is necessary but not sufficient for C’s being instantiated, the same being true of B’s being instantiated. Tommy’s existing is necessary but not sufficient for 1’s being true, the same being true of somebody’s being a smoker. While none of this demonstrates definitively that 1 is identical with S or that 1’s being true is identical with S’s being instantiated, we have, I believe, found enough of a match between 1/1’s being true and S/S’s members’ being instantiated to warrant looking into the idea that they might be one and the same. 3.0 The unity of the proposition How does 1 combine Tommy with the property of smoking?

It follows that, if TD is right, CB says the same thing as: (CB3) \"Something uniquely invented bifocals, and any such thing is a unique first postmaster general; and something was a unique first postmaster general, and any such thing is a unique inventor of bifocals.” It is readily seen that CB3 is more succinctly expressed as follows (the “R” stands for “Russell”): (CBR) \"There is some one thing that uniquely invented bifocals and was also a unique first postmaster general.” To sum up, if TD is right, then CB means the same thing as CBR. It is easily verified that, indeed, CB is true exactly if CBR is true. TD thus seems to get the right result. (Why “seems”? See Section 11.1) Given that CBR is non-trivial—given that historical knowledge is needed to know it—TD readily explains why CB is non-trivial. 3.0 An aside concerning the difference sentence-type logic and sentence-token logic On a first reading, go directly to Section 4.0; skip this section. Why do I say that TD \"seems\"...",

Chomsky (1957) made the very same mistake, though in a less brazen way, when he famously said that “colorless green ideas sleep furiously” is meaningless but that, since it has the right syntactic properties, is a bona fide sentence. On one of its two disambiguations, it says that there are ideas that are both colorless and green, all of them furious sleepers. Thus disambiguated, “colorless green ideas sleep furiously” is meaningful, but its meaning isn’t worth affirming. On its other disambiguation, it says that anything that is a member of the class of colorless green things that are ideas is also a member of the class of things that sleep furiously. In other words, it says that nothing that falls into the first class fails to fall into the second class. Thus disambiguated, that sentence is true but trivial: given that the first class is empty, it follows vacuously that there is no member of the first class that isn’t also a member of the second class. It’s obvious that the first class cannot possibly have any members and therefore cannot possibly have any members in common with any other class. So, thus disambiguated, that sentence affirms a proposition that, being vacuously true and therefore devoid of significant information, is not worth affirming. Thus, contrary to what Chomsky says, “colorless green ideas sleep furiously” is perfectly meaningful. In fact, it’s hyper-meaningful, since it has two meanings. One of them is a correct (but trivial) proposition; the other is a false (and absurd) proposition. Triviality and falsity are properties of meanings. So Chomsky’s contention is proven false---and not, contrary to what he seems to think, proven correct---by the very fact that, depending on how it is disambiguated, “colorless green dreams sleeps furiously” is absurd or trivial. Russell claimed that “quadruplicity drinks procrastination” is a bona fide sentence that is meaningless. But that claim is false; the reasons for this are similar to those just given in connection with “colorless green ideas sleep furiously.” First of all, unless “quadruplicity” has a meaning, this sentence of Russell’s is no more a sentence than “drinks procrastination.” So it must...",

In that case, TF* is simply false. For TF* falsely says the truth of P is contingent on the truth of TF*, which is not the case. If P does not pre-date TF*, then TF is simply false; for it starts with the words “there exists a proposition P such that.” Even if that proposition pops into existence by the end of the TF*, TF* is false, since it affirmed the existence of some proposition that pre-dated TF*’s completion. 3.0 Russell’s Paradox and the Theory of Types Other sentences that are obviously comparable to “I am now lying” are “this sentence is false” and “I’m a Cretan, and all Cretans are liars.” But there exist sentences that, it has been argued, are meaningless and that, unlike those two, are not in any obvious way modeled on “this sentence is false.” The best known example of such a sentence is[185]: (RP) K is a member of itself iff K is not a member of itself, where K is the class of all classes that are not members of themselves. (If K is a member of itself, then, since K includes only classes that aren’t members of themselves, then K is not a member of itself; and if K is not a member of itself, then, since K includes every class that is not a member of itself, K is a member of itself.)[186]",

According to Priest, since that proposition is both true and false, we must reject the law of non­contradiction.[187] In a moment, we’ll see why Priest’s reasoning is spurious. Unlike Priest, Bertrand Russell held that the law of non-contradiction is correct and, therefore, that there is no proposition that RP expresses. But Russell has a very different view from us as to why RP fails. Russell’s view is embodied in his famous “Theory of Types” (“TT” for short). According to TT, any given sentence belongs to a certain \"type\"; given any two types, one is higher than the other. The lowest type is Type1. Sentences of Type1 concern “individuals.” (An individual is anything spatiotemporal and, therefore, anything that isn't a set, property, sentence or proposition. In this context, for the sake of expediency, references to \"classes\" will be short-hand for references to classes and to properties and to propositions and to sentences.) Sentences of Type2 concern individuals and classes whose members are individuals. (Sentences of Type2 thus concern inter alia sentences of Type1.) Sentences of Type3 concern everything with which sentences of Type2 are concerned as well as classes of classes of individuals.[188] In general, for any whole number n, sentences of Typen+1 may concern everything with which sentences of Type n are concerned and, unlike sentences of Type n, sentences of Type n+1 may concern classes of Type n. A consequence of TT is that, if the free variable in “x is a member of class C”, where C is of Typem, is replaced with an expression denoting a class of Typem or higher, the resulting sentence is meaningless, i.e. there is no proposition that it affirms and it is therefore neither true nor false. So, according to TT, “C is a member of C” is meaningless, and so is its negation. TT entails that RP is no more meaningful than “blurka derka derk.\" Given his acceptance of TT, Russell understandably holds it to be a failing of the English language that it permits the construction of sentences like RP. 3.1 Why the theory of types is false RP is ambiguous; there are two ways of disambiguating it. RP can be taken to be to the same effect as: (RP1) There exists some class K such that all and only those classes...",

Given these suppositions, it is ipso facto indeterminate what exactly SB entails and what is entailed by it. If it is objectively indeterminate exactly what features a thing must have to be bald, then it is for that very reason indeterminate, for any x, exactly what entails, and also what is entailed by, the proposition (not—nota bene—the sentence): (XB) ‹x is bald›, for any x. Thus, a consequence of the supposition that SB is objectively indeterminate is that it is indeterminate what SB entails and also what is entailed by it. But the very idea of such a proposition is not a coherent one. Propositions are individuated by what they entail. Different entailment relations, different propositions. So until the entailment relations of some sentence-like string of verbiage have been fixed, no proposition has been identified to that verbiage; and all we have is, at most, a sentence-schema. 5.2 An objection to the argument just presented I have heard it said that: (ER)[195] Propositions are not individuated by their entailment relations. The proposition that 1 + 1 = 2 obviously isn’t identical with the proposition that triangles have three sides. But a given proposition entails/is entailed by the one just in case it entails/is entailed by the other.” Obviously 1+1 =2 and triangles have three sides are different propositions. But contrary to what ER assumes, they don't coincide in respect of their entailment relations. The way [196] in which for some n, n + 2 follows from 1+1 =2 differs—quite dramatically—from the way (or, rather, any one of the infinitely many possible ways) in which for some n, n + 2 follows from triangles have three sides. A corollary is that, until it is settled what the entailment relations are of a given sentence, it ipso facto hasn’t been settled which proposition is meant by that sentence. (This doesn’t mean that one has to know what all of those relations are. No one knows what all of the entailment relations are of “1 + 1 = 2.” But, the semantic rules of the English language being what they are, it is indeed fixed what those entailment relations are.)

What is the relevant difference? “Sand-castles are products of human artifice, whereas heaps of sand are not.” First of all, heaps of sand are often products of human artifice; second of all, there are structures (e.g., plants) that are not the products of artifice that are definitely heaps and wouldn’t be heaps if, other things being equal, they were made of sand. The difference between a heap of sand and a sand-castle seems to lie in the fact that there are quite strict conditions that a grain of sand must satisfy to become part of a sand-castle, whereas there are no conditions, apart from some very generic ones, that a grain of sand must satisfy to become part of a heap of sand. To become part of a given sand­castle, a given grain of sand must be affixed to the sand-castle in such a way that it either (a) provides extra support for the walkway connecting the two towers or (b) completes some otherwise incomplete decoration on the castle, etc. But to become part of a heap of sand, a given grain of sand need only be adjacent with one or more of that heap’s existing constituents. These points make it clear how to solve a paradox that is similar to P3 and that is to be solved in much the same way: (P3#) A single grain of sand is not a heap. If n grains of sand, no matter how they are arranged, don’t jointly constitute a heap, then adding another grain to those grains won’t yield a heap, no matter how that extra grain is added to that heap. What makes it seem that (P3#) is hard to solve is that the word “heap” hasn’t been defined. I don’t mean that it hasn’t been precisified[201], but that it hasn’t been disambiguated. If a “heap” refers to a structure, as opposed to an amorphous mound, of a certain kind, then, depending on what sort of structure that is, adding one more grain of sand to a structure consisting of n grains of sand quite definitely will turn a non-heap into a heap.

Chapter 8 Do We Think in Words? 1.0 Two different ways that knowledge of a language might enhance intelligence It is obvious that knowledge of a language makes one more intelligent in at least some respects. Consider the thought that authoritarian governments tend to be less responsive to the needs of their constituents than democratic governments. Could one grasp that thought without knowing some language or other? We have, I think, at least some inclination to say “no.” And, more generally, we are reluctant to regard creatures that cannot interact with reality through a language, or in any case through some sort of symbolic medium or other, as being capable of grasping, let alone delineating the consequences of, abstract principles or therefore of thinking about reality in a discursive manner. My own view, as we’ll see shortly, is that this is false—that whatever one can grasp through language, one must be able to grasp independently of language. But this, I grant, is a counterintuitive view; and, speaking personally, it was only after trying to defend the negation of that view, and finding that it was impossible to do so, that I came to accept it. Still, our untutored intuitions do, I think, incline us to hold that, but for knowledge of a language (of some kind or other), a creature would be incapable of thinking discursively about the world. But untutored intuitions are not always probative. And sometimes they are inconsistent with one another, this being one of those cases. For, while we are reluctant to impute discursive thought to the language-less, we also strongly feel that we sometimes have thoughts of considerable sophistication that we don’t know how to put into words; and, if that is right, then it seems to follow that not all discursive thought is language-dependent.

What follows is that thoughts, unlike itches and tickles, aren’t phenomenologically pregnant. Incidentally, the mistake Wittgenstein is making here is very similar to a mistake that David Hume makes in connection with the nature of personal identity. David Hume argues that there is nothing to one’s mind other than the conscious events that populate it.[210] His argument is that, when he introspects, he only encounters various tickles, pains, and other sensations. This argument assumes that everything there is to know about one’s mind is to be known in the same quasi-perceptual, phenomenology-drenched way in which we know of our sensations. But this assumption is blatantly false. I know that I believe that 2 + 2 = 4, and I know it in a relatively direct way. But it isn’t because I experience some sensation or mental image or other phenomenologically pregnant entity that I know this. Wittgenstein’s view that thinking consists of manipulating expressions is inconsistent with the fact that, unless one can think, one cannot use expressions meaningfully. If I just bark out sounds, having no idea what they mean, I’m not in any real sense using language. For my noise-making to be speech, it must be guided by a knowledge of what those noises mean. Wittgenstein is right that the sensations and images that pass through one’s mind when one is having a given thought do not constitute that thought. But he’s wrong to conclude that thinking isn’t a psychological process. (As previously stated, what he should have concluded is that not all psychological activity consists of images and sensations.) He’s also wrong to conclude that those images categorically have no significant cognitive function. Mental imagery facilitates thought. Thanks to it, we have thoughts that we otherwise simply couldn’t have. Given this data, I would suggest the following. Though not themselves constitutive of thought, mental images allow us to manage thought-processes that we otherwise couldn’t manage. Just as one can manipulate otherwise uncontrollable patterns of electrical activity by manipulating the icons on one’s computer desktop, so one can manipulate otherwise uncontrollable patterns of ratiocinative activity by manipulating cognitive imagery. There is another relevant point. Consciousness is a place where there are different streams of cognitive activity—where otherwise mutually isolated streams of cognitive activity can...",

But meanings are not themselves understood. They’re no more understood than the property of being a cat is a cat. Consider the expression “I.” I’m referring, not to specific occurrences (utterances, inscriptions) of that expression, but to that expression itself—the expression-type, in other words, as opposed to its tokens. The meaning of that expression is some rule that assigns referents to its tokens depending on the circumstances. More precisely, the meaning of “I” is a rule to the effect that a token t of that expression that is uttered by x refers to x. My knowing that “I” has that meaning is part of what enables me to understand utterances of “I’m getting really bored,” “I really like snow-boarding,” etc. But that meaning is not itself understood. Meanings are either grasped or they’re not. There’s no such thing as grasping a meaning but not understanding it. A consequence is that meanings don’t have to be interpreted. It’s incoherent to suppose that Hoigaard (who, let’s assume, is Norwegian) should be able to grasp this meaning, but fail to see that people were referring to themselves when they said “I.\" This isn’t to say, what would clearly be false, that one automatically recognizes every consequence of every principle that one grasps. People fail to see the consequences of the principles they grasp. In fact, since any given proposition has infinitely many consequences, people fail to grasp infinitely many consequences of anything that they grasp. But to the extent that one’s grasp of a given principle is determinative of what one knows, there isn’t a gap between grasping meaning, on the one hand, and applying it, on the other. And to the extent that one doesn’t see the consequences of some meaning or principle that one grasps, it isn’t because one has failed to interpret it. A story will clarify these points.

This follows from the fact that W* is semantically just like our world.(If John McCain had become President in 2008 instead of Barack Obama, “the U.S. President” would, given the semantic rules that we use, refer to McCain. But, given those very same rules, “Barack Obama” would still refer to Barack Obama. In other words, if x is the person who in our world is referred to as “Barack Obama,” “Barack Obama” would refer to x in W*. Similarly, if Mars were the LMS, as opposed to Venus, “the LMS” would, given the semantic rules that we use, refer to Mars. But given those same rules, “Venus” would still refer to Venus. In other words, if x is the planet that in our world is referred to as “Venus,” “Venus” would refer to x in W*. “Venus,” like “Barack Obama,” is thus a rigid designator. If x is what “Venus” in fact refers to, x is what “Venus” would refer to in any world semantically like ours. But “the LMS,” like “the current U.S. President,” is not a rigid designator; it refers to different things in semantically identical situations. (It used to refer to Carter; now it refers to Obama. But the semantic rules governing that expression haven’t changed in the least in the meantime.) In general, proper names are rigid designators. “Hesperus” and “Phosphorous” are proper names. Therefore, unlike “the LMS” and “the FES,” they are rigid designators. So as long as the semantic rules of English haven’t changed, there is some one object x such that: (i) “Hesperus” refers to x, and so does “Phosphorous”; and, consequently, such that: (ii) each of ‹Hesperus has phi› and ‹Phosphorous has phi› is true exactly if x has phi; a...",

    "text": "In any case, it’s clear that Quine’s rejection of analytic truth wasn’t the effect, but was instead the cause of his acceptance of the bizarre and unwieldy argument of his that we considered earlier. Quine obviously produced that argument post hoc, hoping to give his idiosyncratic form of empiricism a solid foundation. Quine’s real reason for denying the existence of analytic truth lay in his staunch empiricism. All philosophers, and indeed non-philosophers, who deny the existence of analytic truth do so because they are staunch empiricists. Thus, when authors deny that there are necessary truths, the underlying sentiment, if not the immediately operative rationale, is this: (NT) If they exist, necessary truths hold no matter what. They hold no matter how the world is and, therefore, no matter what observations one has. So, if they exist, they can be known independently of observation. But it’s unscientific to think that anything could be known in any way other than through empirical observations. Therefore, there are no necessary truths. 6.2 Why NT is a spurious argument All knowledge of the spatiotemporal world is rooted in observation. But there’s more to doing science than making observations. The observations are only a means to an end, the end being the acquisition of theoretical knowledge. We’ll now see that non-observational knowledge is a precondition for theoretical knowledge and also that it is always necessary truths that are known non-observationally. Our senses give us raw data. Raw data is the foundation of all empirical knowledge. But data cannot interpret itself. And even if it could, it wouldn’t relieve you of the burden of having to interpret the data for yourself. For argument’s sake, suppose that the data were self-interpreting, and that its self-interpretations were disclosed to you in periodic reports. Any such report would itself be given to you in terms of raw data that you’d have to analyze, a consequence being that you couldn’t even understand the report unless you already knew how to interpret the data. Second, once you did understand the report, you’d have no good reason to trust it unless you could find some independent corroboration for it. Finding such corroboration would involve coming up with your own interpretation of the data and seeing how well it matched the interpretation in the report. So even if per impossible perceptual data could self-interpret, one could learn nothing about the external world from those...",

    "text": "Given a true statement S, there is a simple test for determining whether it is empirical or analytic. If, in order to justify acceptance of S, you must cite empirical data, it’s empirical. To justify your acceptance of the statement that Smith has gained 20 pounds in the last year, you must cite empirical data (e.g., sense-perceptions that you have had of Smith or of affirmations on the part of reliable sources as to Smith’s weight situation). But your acceptance of DN can be justified only by insight into its meaning; it cannot possibly be justified on observational grounds. Of course, one might justify one’s acceptance of DN by citing the fact that one has heard some authority affirm it; and, of course, one’s knowledge of that fact is observation-based. But those observations justify DN only to the extent that the authority figures in question understand why, for reasons that lie entirely in DN’s content and have nothing to do with anything one perceives, that statement must be true. Testimony-based knowledge of analytic truths, if it exists, is parasitic on non-observational knowledge of them. And it’s doubtful whether such knowledge really exists. If I don’t understand why DN is true, and I accept it only because somebody I trust does so, then I don’t really know it. What I accept is not, it seems to me, quite what the authority figure in question accepts. That person really accepts DN. But what I accept isn’t DN, and is instead some statement along the lines of: “since so and so is authoritative, and since so and so affirmed DN, that statement is probably right”—which, unlike DN itself, is empirical. Sense-perception adds to one’s knowledge in two different ways. In some cases, it does so by transmitting information about the external world. If I see Jim playing soccer, my visual perception adds to my knowledge by transmitting to me the correct message that Jim is playing soccer. In other cases, sense-perception merely activates some purely ratiocinative process. The ratiocination-activating role of sense-perceptions must be distinguished from its information-transmitting role.",

    "text": "What is “formal truth”? What does it mean to describe (1), for example, as “formally true”? Here’s the canonical answer (“FT” stands for “formal truth,” of course): (FT) Formal truth is syntactic truth. A sentence is “syntactically true” if, given only its syntactic structure, it cannot fail to be true. Thus, a sentence is formally true if no sentence having the same syntactic structure is false. FT cannot be accepted. A linguist would say that (1) “grass is green or grass is not green” has the same syntax as (2) “grass is green and grass is not green.” As linguists use the word “syntax,” two expressions have the same syntax if the way in which the one is built out of its parts is identical with the way in which the other is built out of its parts. For example, “Bill hates Ted” and “Laura loves Sally,” though having very different meanings, have the same syntax, the reason being that they’re structurally identical. The one is built out of its simple constituents in the very way that the other is built out of its constituents. Thus, it isn’t because of any structural differences between them that they have different meanings. The relevant difference is substructural. It lies in the fact that the meaning of “and” is different from that of “or.” So the difference between (1) and (2) is like the difference between “John is tall” and “Mary is short”: it lies entirely in the fact that the primitive, semantically unstructured constituents of the one have different meanings from their counterparts in the other. Thus, relative to what linguists mean by “syntax” (and “syntactic,” etc.), it’s a non­starter to say that “formal truth” is syntactic truth. Logicians and philosophers obviously have in mind some very different understanding of the word “syntax” when they identify “formal” truth with “syntactic” truth. They don’t have in mind sentential (or phrasal) structure. What do they have in mind? What do philosophers mean when they say that a formally true sentence is one that holds entirely in virtue of its “syntax”? What do they mean when they describe some statement as a “formal truth”? 7.4.1 Quine on formal truth W.V.O. Quine (1908–2000) gave a characteristically intelligent and straightforward answer to this important question: a sentence S is formally true if, given any expression in S that isn’t a logical constant, it isn’t possible to produce...",

Given any expression in (1) other than the logical constants in it (viz., “either . . . or . . .” and “not”), replacing that expression with another belonging to the same grammatical category results in truth. There are two problems with Quine’s analysis. First, it doesn’t say what is so special about those items; it doesn’t say what these so-called “logical constants” have in common with one another that other expressions not on the list don’t have in common with them. And until that information is provided, there’s nothing to prevent one from extending that list in arbitrary ways. Unless that list was generated by some rule, anything can be added to it without diminishing its integrity, since it has no integrity to begin with. But if it was generated by some rule, then Quine’s answer fails to identify it and thus fails to say what formal truth is. An analogy may help. When asked to define the expression “number,” I simply list the various different kinds of numbers (“real,” “whole,” “rational,” “imaginary,” etc.). Have I answered the question? No. Even though I’ve listed the various different kinds of numbers, I haven’t said what numbers are, and I thus haven’t provided any reason why fractions are on that list but birds are not. Accordingly, my answer doesn’t give anyone a reason not to extend that list as he or she pleases—not to decide that birds and rocks are numbers. Of course, nobody would extend the list in such an absurd way. But that’s only because our intuitions strongly suggest that there is some characteristic had in common by reals, rationals, etc., that birds and rocks don’t have. Second, there are truths not covered by Quine’s analysis that don’t appear to differ in any relevant respect from those covered by that analysis. Many modal statements are in this category—for example, “if it’s necessarily the case that Smith is a mammal if Smith is a dog, then if it’s necessarily the case that Smith is a mammal if it’s necessarily the case that Smith is a dog.” There...",

There are maximally generic truths that aren’t formal—for example, “nothing can wholly pre-exist itself,” “nothing spatiotemporal can lack causal properties,” “nothing non-spatiotemporal can have causal properties,” “inductive inference isn’t an appropriate method of reasoning for non-empirical disciplines.” Given any one of these sentences, it’s easy to show that there are false sentences having the same syntactic form. For example, the first of those sentences has the same form as “nothing spatiotemporal can have causal properties,” which is obviously false. One could argue that these truths aren’t sufficiently generic. But then it would be very unclear what exactly “sufficiently generic” meant in this context, and the suspicion would arise that, so far as it had any coherent meaning, “sufficiently generic” meant “not a counterexample to this particular theory of formal truth.” Also, whether a sentence expresses a generic truth has nothing to do with its form. The truth expressed by “if everything has a given property, then any given thing has that property” is surely a maximally generic one. But that truth could obviously be expressed by a primitive, syntactically unstructured symbol. In fact, there is no form that sentences must have if they are to express that truth or any other. So, if “formal truth” is taken to be a characteristic of expressions of some kind, then it’s simply false to identify “formal truth” with “maximally generic” truth. And if “formal truth” isn’t meant in this way, then it’s simply irrelevant to our current inquiry.",

The term “perceptual” means having to do with sense-perception—that is, with sight, hearing, sound, taste, smell, bodily sensations (e.g., stomach aches), and also sensations of motion and resistance. I know that there is a computer in front of me because I can see it. (In any case, this is part of the story: there’s more to it, as we’ll see later.) I know that the stove is hot because I touched it. I know that one cup is heavier than another because I feel a greater degree of resistance when I try to move the one than when I try to move the other. (Notice that this last kind of perception isn’t identical with one’s sense of touch, even though it involves the use of touch.) The term “introspective” refers to the direct awareness that one often has of one’s own mental contents. Right now I am aware of the fact that I am having thoughts—that, more specifically, I am having thoughts about the theory of knowledge (I’m writing about it), about this chapter (I hope that I’ve finished writing it by tomorrow), and about tonight’s dinner (it’ll be chicken). My knowledge of this is not based on the use of my senses: I don’t see or touch those thoughts. At the same time, that knowledge seems not to involve my making inferences: I seem to be directly, non-inferentially aware that I am having them. Bearing all of this in mind, let us consider the question: under what circumstances is one justified in having a belief? Many different kinds of facts can be known; and, as we’ll see, the way in which a belief must be justified for it to be knowledge depends on the category into which the fact in question falls. But there are ultimately only three sources of justification: (a) perceptual evidence, (b) introspective evidence, and (c) rational inference. Some cases of knowledge involve only (c); some cases of knowledge are a combination of (a) and (b); the majority of cases involve a combination of both (a) and (c). Some philosophers[238] have argued that whenever (a) is involved, so is (b). 2.2 Can testimony constitute a source of justification? There is much that a given person knows that he...",

But K is much too vague to be considered a solution to the problem at hand. What does the word “non-accidentally” mean in this context? Until we know the answer to that, we don’t know what knowledge is. We’ll now try to supply that answer. 3.2 This position refined Let’s consider Russell’s clock story. You were right to believe that it’s 4:00 P.M., and you are also justified in having that belief. Your immediate justification consists in your belief that: (RT) The clock is now telling me that it’s 4:00 P.M. But by itself a belief in RT wouldn’t be enough to justify you in believing that it’s 4:00 P.M. If you had no grounds for accepting RT, or only bad grounds, your acceptance of it would not provide you with any justification for believing the time to be 4:00 P.M. But you are justified in accepting RT; and here is that justification: (OB) In my extensive past experience, the clock has always been right. I also know that the building superintendent, who is in charge of making sure all the clocks are working, is very capable and diligent. These facts ensured that, if the clock says that it’s a certain time of day, that’s because it really is that time of day. That’s why the clock is now telling me that it’s 4:00 P.M. Of course, the italicized part of OB is identical with RT. Notice that OB is an explanation of a fact—of the fact that the clock is now telling you that it’s 4:00 P.M. It is on the basis of your acceptance of RT that you believe the time to be 4:00 P.M. But OB is the wrong explanation of RT. The right explanation is that the clock is broken and, for that reason, always reads 4:00 P.M. A story will help us move forward. You believe that Larry is in Texas, and your belief is justified.

A correct rule can be obtained by replacing a counter-exampled rule with one that is duly hedged with exception clauses. (So, supposing that Smith is the one non-black raven, then “all ravens other than Smith are black” is indeed a correct rule.) But a duly hedged rule is not a principle.

Drunk driving is to crashing what being exposed to radiation is to getting cancer. It is not what, in the just-described society, being blond is to getting cancer. As we’ll see in Chapter 12, empiricists think of principles as being watered-down rules—as being expressed by categorical statements to which there are exceptions. This isn’t the right way to think about them. Principles are better thought of as registering the existence of defeasible forces. Being drunk can be thought of as a car-crash-conducive force (or, more likely, confluence of forces) that, like most forces, can be overridden.

The one consists of awareness of people (or, more generally, objects); the other consists of awareness of truths. There is reason to think that up to a point, but probably not entirely, the first kind of knowledge collapses into the second. The reason for this is that, with certain very specific exceptions, awareness of objects is identical with knowledge of truths of a certain kind—that, more specifically, it is identical with knowledge of truths to the effect that certain descriptions are in fact satisfied. A story will help clarify what it means to say that a description is “satisfied.” In order to collect insurance money, an unscrupulous store owner falsely claims that he is robbed. He gives a description of the (nonexistent) perpetrator of the (non-existent) crime. He goes to the police station and tells the police: “the person who robbed me was a tall male; he had a tattoo that said “I love mom” on his forehead; he had pointy gold teeth . . .” Here the store owner is really saying that there exists an object (a person) that has certain characteristics. To put it another way, he is saying that a certain description is satisfied, that description being “an entity that is a human being who robbed me and has pointy gold teeth and is male and . . .” Any statement to the effect that a description is satisfied is known as an existence-claim. So the store owner is affirming the following existence-claim: (1) There exists an object that is a person x such that x robbed me, x is a male, x has pointy gold teeth, x has a tattoo that says “I love mom” on his forehead . . . That existence-claim is false, of course, the reason being that the relevant description (the italicized part of 1) is not satisfied. But, of course, many existence-claims are true, the reason being that many descriptions are satisfied. For example, the following existence-claim is true: (2) There exists a person who is currently (in Feb. 2008) the U.S. President. And the reason that 2 is true is, of course, that the relevant description (the italicized part of 2) is satisfied. (It is satisfied by George W. Bush.)",

Thus, any case of induction by enumeration that isn’t an instance of the gambler’s fallacy involves the positing of some mechanism or law that, were it to exist, would explain a certain concomitance—it involves, in other words, a case of inference to the best explanation. The best explanation of the fact that all known phi’s are psi’s is that, thanks to some mechanism or, in any case, principled connection of some kind or other, a thing’s being a phi disposes it to be a psi; and as soon as such a mechanism has been posited, but not one second sooner, your knowing of a given thing that it’s a phi is a reason for you to hold that it’s a psi. So any non-fallacious “induction by enumeration” is nothing other than a case of inference to the best explanation (or, more precisely, is a case of applying some theory that embodies an inference to the best explanation). Hume’s argument assumes that it is only through induction by enumeration that the past is any guide to the future. It assumes that, so far as we have any reason to believe that future phi’s will be psi’s, it is that past phi’s have been psi’s. But this assumption is dead wrong. The fact that past phi’s were psi’s, is not, in and of itself, reason to hold that future phi’s will be psi’s; it is such a reason only to the extent that it suggests some mechanism that disposes phi’s to be psi’s.

During that brief period, nothing collides with his eyes that bears information about anything external. (Light that bears such information collides with his eyelids. But his eyelids don’t in their turn transmit that information to the relevant part of his brain.) After he opens his eyes, light-rays bearing information collide with this eyes, leading by way of the previously described process to visual experiences that bear structural information concerning their external causes. So the reason that his pre-and post-blink visual experiences are so similar is that they have commensurately similar external causes. The non-skeptic accepts (c). The skeptic neither accepts nor rejects any one of (a)-(c). The skeptic says that, given any one of those hypotheses, it is no more rational to accept it than it is to accept either of the other two.

An image can’t just be an image of something or other on the mat; it must be an image of some particular thing on the mat. So if the thought that something were on the mat were identical with an image, it would be identical with the thought that (say) Snoopy was on the mat. But those thoughts aren’t identical. Similar arguments show that other general thoughts can’t be identical with images. Consider the thought that all birds have feathers. An image of all birds —an image that depicted every single bird in existence—would be indistinguishable from an image of (say) 84 billion birds. But the thought 84 billion birds have feathers is different from the thought that all birds have feathers. So neither thought is an image. Obvious adaptations of this argument show that no image can be identical with the thought that most birds/many birds/all possible birds have feathers. So, really, no thought that can be expressed by a sentence is identical with an image. This shows that many thoughts aren’t images and, since sense-perceptions are images, therefore have contents very different from those of any sense-perception. 5.2.1 Berkeley’s unwitting anti-empiricism Ironically, it was that greatest of empiricists, George Berkeley, who made it clear that general thoughts cannot possibly be identical with images. Berkeley’s argument coincides with our own: any image is specific in ways that any one of those thoughts won’t be. (Berkeley didn’t make the correlative point that thoughts are specific in ways that images are not.) Berkeley saw that if all thoughts are images, then there are certain thoughts we can’t have. Berkeley also saw that, if empiricism is correct, thoughts must be images. Finally, Berkeley saw that, given these two points, empiricism is inconsistent with the presumption that we can have general thoughts. But instead of rejecting empiricism because it has this absurd consequence, Berkeley held that, indeed, we can’t have general thoughts. This position, in addition to being obviously wrong, is self-defeating, since the thought that there are no general thoughts is itself a general thought. Berkeley qualified his position by saying that, although we couldn’t directly grasp general propositions, we could grasp non-general propositions that we took to stand for general ones.

A given room, at a given time, seems cold to someone who just got out of a sauna and warm to someone who just came in from a blizzard. Step 2: The external world is totally unknowable unless we suppose that, typically, things are as they appear. Commentary on Step 2: This is a corollary of empiricism. Empiricism says: what we know, we know strictly on the basis of our senses. So if our senses tell us that x is big, then we’re entitled to believe x is big—period. One cannot, in general, legitimately second-guess what one’s senses are telling one (at least not if one is an empiricist). One can throw out patently deviant perceptions (e.g., perceptions of suddenly appearing pink elephants). But this covers only an infinitesimal minority of our sensory experience. Step 3: Things are knowable. It would be absurd to say that we don’t know anything about rocks, trees, etc. Step 4: Things can’t have incompatible properties. A number can’t be both even and odd. A thing can’t be both big and small. A body of water can’t be both hot and cold. Step 5: Suppose, if only for argument’s sake, that things exist independently of our perceptions of them. Suppose that, whether or not somebody perceives it, the vase exists (the same being true of the rock, the tree, etc.). In that case, things will have incompatible properties. Explanation of Step 5: Remember Step 3—we do know about external objects. They are not unknown. So they are as they appear. Well, they appear to have incompatible properties. One and the same thing appears both big and small, hot and cold, fast and slow, etc. Step 6: (this step is crucial to understanding Step 7, so bear with me): There’s nothing incoherent in the idea that one and the same thing should appear both big and small, hot and cold. Clarification: Suppose I say “Bill is in Virginia right now” and I then say “Bill is not in Virginia right now.” Obviously there cannot be some one thing of which both statements are correct representations. But there’s nothing incoherent in the idea that both statements should be made. While it is incoherent to hold there is...",

The man is moving away from the tree in one direction, and you are moving away from the tree in the opposite direction. Each of (i)–(iv) is consistent with the raw information contained in the previously described perception. But a world where any one of (i)–(iii) was correct would ceteris paribus be a world that was replete with causal anomalies absent from a world where (iv) was correct. This means that, if one were to countenance any one of (i)–(iii), one’s understanding of the world and the forces that govern it would undergo a weakening that it would not undergo were one instead to countenance (iv). It is for this reason, then, that ceteris paribus one countenances (iv), and not any one of (i)–(iii). It is for this reason, that, after exercising vigorously, one believes that one’s heart rate sped up and not that the rest of the world slowed down; that, after lifting weights for a year, one became stronger and not that everything became lighter; that, on leaving a steam room, one’s body has become warmer and not that the world that has become colder; and so on.

What one sense-perceives is that the water is warmer than x and colder than y. Given this information, one is justified in believing that the water’s temperature is 78° just in case, in doing so, one is undermining the integrity of one’s understanding of physical reality less than one would be in not doing so. Basically, objects’ actual properties are inferred from sense-perceptions and not directly sense-perceived; and the relevant rule of inference is: “of the various ways of accommodating the raw, sensory data that you’ve been given (and there will always be several such ways), the right one is the one that is the least...",

For a thing to have a given primary property is for it to have an effect of a given kind on the conditions that objects must meet to occupy a certain region of space-time. By virtue of being round (or gaseous), a thing has certain effects on would-be occupants of its current location that, other things being equal, it wouldn’t have were it square-shaped (or solid) instead. According to some, the essence of Berkeley’s argument for idealism is that primary properties are really secondary properties.[284] Thus interpreted, Berkeley’s argument is as follows: Berkeley’s argument (BA): For a thing to have a given secondary property is for it to taste, smell, feel, etc., a certain way. Some philosophers hold that, in this respect, shape, size, and other so-called primary properties are fundamentally different from secondary properties. But they’re wrong. Shape, size, etc., are quite as observer-dependent as taste, color, etc. When you’re near the house, it looks big (we’re assuming that your perception is accurate); and when you’re far from the house, it looks small (same qualification). Of course, we could say that the size an object seems to have is different from the size it actually has. But in that case, we’d be stuck saying that our senses tell us nothing, or next to nothing, about the external world, which is absurd. It follows (for the reasons given earlier) that the objects of sense-perception are identical with our perceptions of them. The problem with BA is that, contrary to what it says, your first house-perception is consistent with your second house-perception. The first perception doesn’t say that the house is big. It tells you how its size compares with those of various objects. It tells you that it’s shorter than the telephone pole next to it, but taller than the cactus in front of it, etc. The comparative information given to you by your second perception is consistent with it. The relative apparent sizes of the cactus, house, and telephone pole are the same. In the second perception, the house appears the way that small things appear when looked at from up close.

Since (setting aside the odd person who owns adjacent houses) nobody is one’s own next-door neighbor, (3) comes out true. So does (2), since x must be y’s next-door neighbor if y is x’s next-door neighbor. Thus, supposing for argument’s sake that Smith and Jones are next-door neighbors, (1) comes out true if “A” refers to Smith and “B” refers to Jones. We have thus modeled (1)–(3). In conjecturing that (so-called) statements such as ‘that rock weighs five pounds’ can be reinterpreted as statements about perceptions, Berkeley was in effect saying that such statements aren’t statements at all—they’re statement forms. Though he didn’t himself put it this way, he was saying (i) that the terms in them (e.g., ‘rock,’ ‘weighs five pounds’) are really variables, and (ii) that true statements would result if those variables were replaced with constants referring to perceptions. Berkeley was wrong about (ii), as we’ve already observed. But he was right about (i). There is no one microstructure that Rover must have if my current perception of him is to be accurate. There is, as we will now see, no one way anything must be if any given perception is to be correct. We’ve seen that our knowledge of the world is strictly comparative.[295] We know how fast a given thing is traveling only to the extent that we know how much faster it is traveling than some other thing. We know how heavy/hot/big/etc., a thing is only to the extent that we know how much heavier/hotter/bigger/etc., that thing is than some other thing. Spatiotemporal knowledge is comparative knowledge. That means that anything—no matter what it’s parts are ‘made of’—whose parts are appropriately interrelated is no more, and no less, consistent with what our sense-perceptions tell us than is any other thing whose parts are thus interrelated. This means that perception apprises us only of structure. Our perceptions (if correct) tell us the structure of the world, and our physical theories (if correct) apprise us of microstructure. Given any two things having the requisite structure, there cannot possibly be any observational basis for holding that it, and not the other thing, is what is really out there....",

That other sentence is one along the lines of: (2) “If Smith closes his eyes for x minutes and then reopens them, the things he sees are where one would expect them to be, given that they are subject to the usual forces.” Berkeley’s own illustration of this principle is particularly effective. The stars are moving, Berkeley points out. A more precise way of putting it, as Berkeley himself makes clear, is that we are moving relative to the stars, and the stars are therefore moving relative to us. But, as Berkeley points out, we don’t see the stars move. The blips in the sky that we see on a given night aren’t in the same relative positions as the blips in the sky that we see on other nights. For this reason, we do a kind of “regression analysis” on the blips that we see over the years. We try to connect the blips seen on night 1 with those seen on night 2, and we try to connect the latter with those seen on night 3, and so on. So if N1...Nn are nights in question, and n is some high number (e.g., 500), we identify curves such that, if it is assumed that those curves are the trajectories of those blips, it follows that those blips obey well-defined, relative simple laws. So the logical form of: (A) “The stars are moving even when nobody is looking at them,” is perspicuously given by the grammatically very different sentence: (B) “If it is assumed that, when we’re not looking at them, the stars obey certain laws and therefore have certain trajectories, we can make observationally accurate predictions that we couldn’t otherwise make, and arrive at observationally correct explanations that we couldn’t otherwise arrive at.” Berkeley said, as clearly as it can be said, that what sentences really mean isn’t what, given their overt forms, they seem to mean.

(Let’s refer to that rock as “R.”) Here’s what’s involved in your seeing R. Some light beam bounced off R. (We’ll refer to that light beam as “L.”) As a result of that collision, L’s structure changed in such a way that R’s structure is now coded in its (L’s) structure. For this reason, L bears information about R. L hits your eyes, disturbing them. Those disturbances reflect L’s structure. Given that L reflects R’s structure, it follows that these disturbances of your eyes reflect R’s structure. Those ocular disturbances therefore encode information about R. The resulting neural impulses transmit this information to some part of you that decodes this information. The results of this decoding are embodied in a visual perception that succeeds in representing R. Light is energy. Things change when bombarded by energy. They don’t always change very much. But there is always some change. It takes time for light, or any other information-bearing process, to travel. During that time-interval, the changes in R that were initiated by L led to other changes in R. Since, for the time being, L is your only source of information about R, and since L gives you dated and otherwise inaccurate information about R, the information encoded in the visual perception that L caused you to have is itself inaccurate. Before we take the next step, I’d like to clarify this point. Let t be the time that you have the visual perception of R that L caused you to have. Obviously t will happen after the time L hits your eyes and t is later than the time that L collided with R. During the time between that collision, on the one hand, and t, on the other, R has changed. Why has it changed? Because the just-mentioned collision made it change. That collision, as we just pointed out, set off processes because of which R changed. What you know, at t, about R is confined to what L tells you.

This is because, contrary to what AR assumes, space and time aren’t vessels that happen not to be empty but could be. The concept occupancy—as in occupying a certain space---is a causal concept. Smith wants to sit in chair x. By virtue of that Jones is already sitting in x, what must happen in order for Smith to sit in x will be very different from what ceteris paribus would otherwise have to happen. Even if Smith just walks over to x and sits down in it, Jones’ body will serve as a buffer between him and x itself. It makes no sense to say that, while Jones is sitting in x, his presence there has consequences as regards what must ensue if, in the next two seconds, Smith is to be sitting in x. It makes no sense to say that, even though Jones is sitting in x, light is passing through the region he is occupying in exactly the way it would pass through that region were it unoccupied. And so on. Spatiotemporal relations are causal relations. (See Chapter 12 for a lengthy discussion of this.) It would make no sense to say that John’s flipping the switch caused the light to turn on, but that the very instance of that light’s turning preceded that very instance of John’s flipping that switch. If the latter caused the former, it ipso facto preceded it.

If it doesn’t conduct electricity, is it copper? If it looks just like solid oak, but you can walk right through it, is it really solid oak? The terms that we use to pick out the objects that participate in the events and facts described by T are nomic terms. In describing something as copper, or water, or human, you are, in so doing, ascribing to it certain causal properties.[308] (You may not know what those causal properties are. There are certain properties P1…Pn such that, if I say that x is a puddle of mercury, the chemist to whom I am speaking will automatically know that, if my statement is correct, x has P1…Pn, so that, in effect, I was in some sense ascribing those properties to x.

It is a matter of philosophical and scientific debate whether, given an event E happening at t, anything other than the entire state of the universe just prior to t can be the complete cause of E. So for all intents and purposes, the expression “the cause of occurrence E” never refers to a sufficient condition for E. “Even though Smith’s being drunk wasn’t sufficient for his crashing the car,” it will be thought, “it was necessary for it. Had he not been drunk, he wouldn’t have crashed.” This is false. Smith’s being drunk wasn’t necessary for his crashing. If he had been sober, but had been driving too fast on an icy road, he might well have crashed. J.L. Mackie (1917–1981) made it clear what is meant by “the cause of E,” as this expression is typically used. Smith’s being drunk wasn’t a necessary condition for his crashing.[319] He could have crashed if sober. But his being drunk was a necessary condition for his crashing under the circumstances. Given that he wasn’t driving a high-performance car on a country road during a clear day, and given that he was driving a low-performance car on a rainy night on a busy street, Smith’s being drunk was, we may suppose, a necessary condition for his crashing. For it could be that, had he been sober, Smith would have narrowly avoided crashing, despite the rain, darkness, and faulty steering mechanism, and that it was only these things plus Smith’s drunkenness that led to the crash. So, if it is to be correct, the statement “Smith’s drunkenness was the cause of the crash” must be taken to mean that, under the operative circumstances, Smith’s being drunk was necessary for his crashing. There are just a few more points to make. First, given that Smith did crash the car, it follows trivially that a sufficient condition for his doing so was fulfilled. Second, whatever that sufficient condition was, it wasn’t necessary. Suppose that what led to the crash was Smith’s driving a low-performance vehicle on a dark, rainy night, while drunk. Even though, by hypothesis, that confluence of circumstance was sufficient for his crashing, it wasn’t necessary. Smith might have crashed even if he’d been driving a high-performance vehicle in broad daylight while stone cold sober. Thus, Smith’s being drunk was an insufficient but...",

Final causes are goals or objectives. x is the material cause of y if x is the material that y is made of. x is the formal cause of y if x is y’s form. (To expedite discussion, we’ll henceforth omit the obvious qualifications relating to the fact that Aristotle didn’t use English words.) Sometimes Aristotle uses the word “form” to refer to shape. But sometimes he uses it to refer to what he elsewhere refers to as “essences.” Those properties that are essential to a given thing jointly constitute its essence; and a property is essential to a given thing if that thing could not lose that property without for that very reason ceasing to exist. The italicized phrase is intended to indicate that the dependence-relation in question is not of a causal nature, and is instead of a logical or constitutive nature. In other words, that relation is comparable to the dependence that triangles have on being three sided, not to the dependence that mammals have on air. Setting aside a few trivialities, pretty much nothing Aristotle has to say about causality has any merit. Aristotle incoherently believes that objects simpliciter---as opposed to objects’ having these or those properties---have essences. This belief, as we’ll soon see, is an incoherent one, and along with the more general coherence of which it is but one instance, it vitiates Aristotle’s views on causality. It is essential to a thing’s being triangle-shaped that it have three sides. But a given triangle-shaped object’s continued existence needn’t depend on its continuing to have three sides. Things change shape. It is essential to a thing’s being water that it consist of H2O molecules. But a given puddle’s continuing to exist needn’t depend on its consisting of such molecules. Things undergo chemical changes without ceasing to exist. Contrary to what Aristotle thought, dependence-relations don’t hold between objects. They hold between events or between statements, depending on whether they’re of a causal or a logical nature. To say that x’s having three sides is essential to x’s being a triangle is to say that “x is a triangle” entails that “x has three sides.” To say that...",

In that case, given some green/triangular object x, the fact in virtue of which x is green—in other words, the distribution of mass-energy in virtue of which x was green—would be spatially and causally indistinguishable from the fact in virtue of which x was triangular. Nonetheless, it wouldn’t be in virtue of its being a closed three-sided (etc.) figure that x was green—it would be in virtue of its having certain reflective properties. And it wouldn’t be in virtue of its having those reflective properties that x was triangular—it would be in virtue of its being a three-sided, straight-edged (etc.) figure. This shows that the meaning of (B) is (C). When occurring in statements affirming logical (as opposed to causal) dependencies, “in virtue of” denotes a relationship holding, not between things or even facts, but between propositions. Given that the occurrence in (A) of “by virtue of” does denote a relationship holding between states of affairs, what are we to say? One response, of course, is to say that it’s ambiguous. But, in addition to appearing very wrong, this response is unnecessary. (A) doesn’t express an entailment. But it does express a dependence-relation holding between statements. The truth of Smith won the argument is, in this context, dependent on the truth of Smith bullied his opponent. In general, “in virtue of,” when occurring in causal contexts, can be interpreted as denoting a form of interpropositional dependence; and we may therefore condense (i) and (ii) into: (iii) Dependence-relations hold between propositions, as opposed to things. 4.2 Functionalism, content-externalism According to a doctrine known as “functionalism,” it is wholly in virtue of what its causes and effects are that a given brain-state (or physical entity of any kind) falls into a given mental category. Anything that has certain causes and certain effects is ipso facto a belief that snow is white or a desire for a world peace or a vitriolic dislike of a certain piece of music.[323] Functionalism is discussed at length in Chapter 22. But a few words on it here are appropriate. Functionalism has no plausibility when it comes to sensations or, more generally, anything that has phenomenal content.

    "text": "We obviously know of many cases of one event’s causing another. We are inclined to think that, in each such case, the one event is the efficient cause of the other. Working jointly, Frank Jackson (1943-) and Philip Pettit (1945–) have shown this to be false. Given almost any known instance of one event’s causing another to occur, the one event is the program-cause, not the efficient cause, of the other. What does the term “program cause” mean? Some scenarios will help us answer this question. There is a kettle on the stove. You turn on the gas. The resulting flames underneath the kettle cause it to heat up and thus cause the water to boil. Let F be the flame. We’re inclined to think that F caused the kettle to heat up. (i) F (or, in any case, F’s having a certain temperature) caused the kettle to heat up. But only a tiny part of F’s surface was in contact with the underside of the kettle. Had the events at those contact points been present, the effect on the kettle would have been the same, even if the other flame-constitutive events were absent. Another example: Statements such as: (ii) high-inflation led to crime, which, coupled with xenophobia on the part of the populace, gave the government a powerful incentive to scapegoat a foreign nation and go to war with them. But causes are much more specific than (ii) suggests. Crime doesn’t do anything, and neither does xenophobia. Things are caused by specific people, performing specific criminal or xenophobic acts. One last example: (iii) The impact of the rock on the window caused the window to shatter. This case is similar to the first. Only a small part of the surface of the rock came into contact with the window—and, in fact, those parts of the rock’s surface came into contact with specific parts of one of the window’s two surfaces. Had the events at those contact points happened, the effect on the window would have been the same, even if no rock had struck the window. But if we say that (i)–(iii) are just wrong, our grounds being that a “cause” of an event E can only be an event that is directly responsible for E’s occurrence, then just about every single causal statement anyone makes will be wrong. But statements like (i)–(iii) obviously convey valuable information. So rather...",

The form of causality mentioned in (i)–(iii) is program-causality. x is a program-cause of y if x consists of events that, in their turn, are directly responsible for y. A country’s being poor consists of various specific states of affairs—various specific people being without funds in various specific situations. The specific situations that constitute a condition of wide-spread poverty will directly cause crimes. And so on. F heats up the pan in the sense that among the events constitutive of F are those that heat up the pan; and it is in the same sense mutatis mutandis that the impact of the rock shattered the window. Thus, Jackson and Pettit have successfully validated ordinary causal statements. They make other important points. One would think that high-resolution causal information is better than low-resolution causal information. But this isn’t always so. What caused the house to burn down? (SA)[327] Arson on Smith’s part was the cause. He threw several Molotov cocktails at the house and up in flames it went. SA obviously doesn’t give us the micro-story. For argument’s sake suppose that some long sentence MS does give us the micro-story. MS will be worthless in terms of giving us information about Smith’s character, and it will be equally worthless in other, comparable respects. There are many principled regularities of which this particular incident is an instance, and we blind ourselves to all but a few of them if we reject any story that isn’t the micro-story. So the macro­story—or, rather, the various different macro-stories—aren’t inferior versions of the micro-story; they aren’t precursors to it that we’ll chuck when we have it. They expose regularities, structures, and counterfactual truths omitted by the micro-story. This shows that biology isn’t just bad physics, that psychology isn’t just bad physiology—it shows that different disciplines are dealing with different program-causes, and therefore distinct and very possibly sui generis nomic connections—that happen at least sometimes to be instantiated by the same efficient (micro) causes. Predictions are almost always made on the basis of a knowledge of program-causes. To predict what’s going to happen, one must know of structures that can be depended on to yield certain outputs, given certain inputs. So far as one lacks such knowledge, one must make predictions on an ad hoc basis, and there are two reasons why this is a problem. First, sub-structural facts tend...",

If x and y are in coincident places, nothing can affect the one without affecting the other. If x and y are not in coincident places, something can affect the one without affecting the other. Thus, x and y are in different places exactly if something affecting the one may fail to affect the other. So if one says that x and y occupy distinct but adjacent places, or that they occupy some one place, one is ipso facto making a causal statement. Thus, Hume’s analysis of causality is circular, given that it analyzes ‹x causes y to occur› in terms of ‹x is spatiotemporally adjacent with y.› 4.1 Problem #3 (continued) Here is a similar line of thought. It would be meaningless to say that object x moved but that its causal liaisons to other objects didn’t change for that very reason. If I approach you, my causal relations to you change, and so do your causal relations to me. After those changes are set aside, there is nothing left: there is no “pure” change in position underlying all the causal changes. Also, the concept of spatial occupancy is a causal concept. What is it for me to be occupying this place? It is for it to be harder than it would otherwise be for you to enter this place. It makes no sense to say: “x is occupying spatial region R, but x’s occupancy of R has no effect on what things other than x must do to occupy R.” To occupy a place is to make it harder, other things equal, than it would otherwise be for other things to enter that place. Hume analyzes causality in terms of the concept of spatial occupancy. E1 causes E2 only if they occupy adjacent, or coincident, spaces. But since E1’s (or E2’s) occupancy of a place is itself to be understood in causal terms, Hume’s analysis analyzes causality in terms of itself and therefore doesn’t analyze it at all. A corollary of the fact that spatiotemporal relations are causal relations is that, contrary to what Hume alleges, we do see causal processes and, moreover, we see them as causal processes. We see nothing instantaneous. Everything we see persists, if only for a short while. Anything...",

If the first view is the right one, there are no event-independent positions. In that case, x’s being adjacent with y is a relation that holds directly between x and y, and to say that some position bears a certain relation to another position is to say that some event bears a certain relation to some other event. If the second view is the right one, the fact described by IP consists in x’s occupying some position that bears a certain relation to a position that is, in turn, occupied by y. In other words, it is only because the positions they occupy are adjacent that x and y are adjacent. Thus, the second view presupposes that there are event-independent, and thus absolute, spatiotemporal positions. Since Hume’s analysis presupposes the correctness of the second view, Hume’s analysis is refuted by the very empirical and philosophical arguments that show the concept of absolute position to be an untenable one. (Further argumentation to the effect that the relational conception of space-time is the right one will be provided in this chapter, in Sections 4.2.2-5.0, and in Chapter 20, Section 8.0.) 4.2.1 Continuity identical with causality Ball A crashes into previously stationary ball B, whereupon B lurches into motion. This is Hume's paradigm of an instance of causality. This change in B's condition appears discontinuous. It would not seem that way were we to have a more high-resolution understanding of the exchange of energy that is actually constitutive of the collision. In general, the more accurate our knowledge of what is involved in any apparently discontinuous change of state, the more we find that no discontinuities were involved. Given information about the aforementioned collision that is slightly more high-resolution than the sort of information about collisions that was available to Hume, it proves to be no more discontinuous than was A's pre-collision state of motion. I now hope to show that Hume was very much led astray, so far as his understanding of causality was concerned, by the technological limitations of his time. 4.2.2 Continuity identical with causality (continued) Hume's paradigms led him to see discontinuity as a sine qua non for causality.

When you are trying to lift a heavy suitcase or trying to arm wrestle a much stronger person, you are, so it would seem, observationally aware of a force. Hume considers this very point. In response to it, he says that what you are aware of is a mere sequence of events. You have various perceptions. Some are visual—you see your opponent’s sweaty, determined face. Some are tactile—you feel your opponent’s increasingly sweaty hand. Some are kinesthetic—you feel your arm moving the wrong way. But Hume says you don’t perceive any force in all this—even though, because you are in the grips of some wrong theories, you think you do. But this seems very wrong. It’s a datum that you feel your arm being forced to move in a way you don’t want it to be. That doesn’t mean that this feeling is accurate. Maybe it’s a hallucination, like one’s visual perception of a pink elephant. But it’s a datum that you have such a feeling, even though it isn’t a datum that it’s accurate; and in denying that it’s a datum, Hume isn’t being true to his own empiricism. Plus, this response of Hume’s is decidedly contrived. If, in describing your arm-wrestling experience, you left out the part about how you felt as though your arm was being moved the wrong way, you’d be seriously under-describing your experience. Thus, if the observational evidence is to be taken at face value, forces do exist. This doesn’t mean that the observational evidence should be taken at face value. But it means that Hume’s denial of causality cannot, if legitimate, be based on strictly empirical grounds. And this means that his supposedly empirical argument against causation (a) isn't empirical and (b) is only as good as some other, purely a priori argument. That other argument, it will be recalled, is as follows (what follows is not a quotation): (NF)[339] The very concept of a force is an incoherent one. Were they to exist, forces would just be more constituents of the physical world. They would thus be no more capable than vases and rocks and so forth of constituting the cement of the universe. The idea of a force that wasn’t that sort of cement is a contradiction in terms. Therefore the concept of force is an incoherent one.” We saw...",

Probability judgments are irrational, given a Humean framework, when they involve extrapolations. Lewis’ metaphysical apparatus gives him a way of sidestepping this problem. Bearing all of this in mind, let’s suppose that, up until time t, whenever a rock with a mass of m or more, moving with a velocity of v or more, has collided with a window of thickness t or less, the window shattered upon impact. In that case, presumably, it’s reasonable to judge that, the next time such a rock strikes such a window, the window will shatter. The non-Lewisian Humean is stuck; he has no way to validate this presumption. The Lewisian isn’t stuck. Here’s what he says[351]: (LA): Let C1 be the class of worlds where, before time t, such windows shatter when struck by such rocks and where, after time t, such windows continued to shatter when struck by such rocks; and let C2 be the class of worlds where, before time t, such windows shatter when struck by such rocks and where, after time t, such windows didn’t shatter when struck by such rocks. C1 has more members than C2. For the non-Lewisian Humean, judgments about what is likely to happen next time are great leaps into the unknown. For the Lewisian Humean, such judgments merely redescribe what is already there. To say that next time such a collision occurs the window is likely to break is to say that there are more worlds where it does break than where it doesn’t. If it’s given that exactly one of the cards in the deck is a King of Spades, it follows trivially that, given an arbitrary card, it has a 1 in 52 chance of being a King of Spades. Our judgments about what will happen to windows in future collisions are equally trivial. 3.1 Why LA fails Any knowledge we have of what happens in other worlds after t will be at least as uncertain as our knowledge of what happens in our own world after t. There are two reasons for this. Any knowledge that we might have about anything in other worlds...",

Should an opponent of M point out this fact, his attempt to refute M would be a success, as it would have met the relevant standards of proof. For, when evaluating a scientific theory, the relevant standard of proof isn’t given by the question “given the sensory data at our disposal, is it logically impossible for that theory to be correct?”, and is instead “given the sensory data at our disposal, would countenancing that theory require us to renounce fruitful theories which there are no independent reasons to reject and which, therefore, we couldn’t reject without repopulating the universe with anomalies that we had long since solved?” It’s obvious and trivial that, given any theory T that concerns the external world, no matter what observations we’ve had; it’s logically possible that T is false. For, as Quine points out, it’s theoretically possibly that everyone is always hallucinating and, therefore, that the data on which any given scientific theory is based is spurious. But, since this platitude is all Quine gives us in the way of substantiating his thesis, he’s effectively done nothing to substantiate it. In any case, unless it’s completely hollow, the Duhem-Quine thesis can’t just say that, for any theory T that concerns the external world, no body of observations analytically entails that T is false. It must therefore be to the effect that, given any body of observations and given any theory T, the explanatory costs of accepting T are no greater and no smaller than the explanatory costs of rejecting T. But that statement is very obviously false. The data being what it is, the explanatory costs of holding onto T far outweigh the explanatory gains of doing so. If we hold onto it, we’re stuck with various anomalies that we wouldn’t otherwise be stuck with.

One possible answer is: A law is what is described by any true universal generalization—that is, by any statement of the form “all phi’s are psi’s.” Few have explicitly given this answer. But we’ll now see that Hempel has no choice but to accept that answer, ridiculous though it is. If the word “law” is taken in this way, DN has the consequence that the following counts as an “explanation” of the fact that the pencil on my desk is yellow[367]: (NE) Premise #1 (description of the relevant natural law): Everything is such that it’s either yellow or it isn’t a pencil on JMK’s desk. Premise #2 (description of initial conditions): x is a pencil on JMK’s desk. Conclusion (thing being explained): x is yellow. But NE isn’t an explanation of the fact that my pencil is yellow. The problem, of course, is that[368]: (YP) Everything is such that it’s either yellow or it isn’t a pencil on JMK’s desk, doesn’t express a natural law. But why not? Because, says Hempel, it doesn’t support counterfactuals. The statement: (ME) Metal expands when heated, expresses a law of nature because a piece of metal that isn’t being heated would expand if it were heated. Nothing comparable holds of YP. Given an arbitrary pencil, YP doesn’t entail that it would be yellow if it were on my desk. In general, says Hempel, laws are expressed by universal generalizations that support counterfactuals. Hempel is surely right that a statement must support counterfactuals if it is to express a natural law. But DN collapses if laws are understood in this way. Let m be some unheated metal object. Why is it that m would expand if it were heated? Because, the laws of nature being what they are, heating m would cause it to expand. So the fact that m would expand if heated is to be understood in terms of the fact that ME expresses a natural law.

But if we know that a thing’s being a phi causes it to be a psi, then we ipso facto already have a wealth of explanations, if only crude ones, at our disposal. For if we know that O is causally responsible for O#, then we ipso facto have an explanation of O#. So relevant regularities---regularities of the sort that DN-advocates obviously have in mind (“DN” being short for “deductive nomological analysis of explanation”)---presuppose the existence of explanations. Thus, DN is either viciously circular or, at best, it provides a correct analysis only of explanations of a derivative and therefore relatively unimportant kind. The exact significance of these remarks will become clear, as will the justification for them, when we consider a* and i*, which we will do right now. The italicized part of 2 obviously does correspond to the sort of regularity that advocates of DN have in mind---but only because it’s already known that a thing’s being made of heated metal causes it to expand.

Unbeknownst to Barry, X belongs to a species whose members can live only in cool, shady places. After a few hours, X dies. It's clear to Barry's supervisor that the cause of X's death was over­exposure to sunlight.

The supervisor thus asks Barry to produce a maximally thorough botanical explanation of X's death. Assume (per impossibile) that Barry has complete knowledge of the microphysical activity constitutive of X’s being placed in the sun, remaining in the sun, and then eventually dying, and also that everything Barry says is correct. Barry gives a thorough and precise description of each and every last micro-event involved in the series of particle-flurries mediating between, and including, X's being placed in the sun and X's dying. He uses no botanical or biological terms. The only non-generic terms that he uses belong to microphysics and mathematics. Did Barry explain X's death? No. We must remember that it is truths that are explained, not (re)distributions of mass-energy. Things aren't explained. Rocks cannot be explained. Propositions about rocks are explained. Events aren't explained. Truths that hold in virtue of events are explained.

Later we’ll discuss why, despite their obvious falseness, people have held (3)–(5). First of all, (2) is not the view that mental entities don’t exist. (2) must be distinguished at all costs from (4). According to (2), perceptions, beliefs, doubts, and so on, all exist—but they are identical with brain-states. The materialist says that, just as water is H2O, so your belief that 1 + 1 = 2 is identical with some pattern of neural stimulation (or some such). Just as the physical chemist isn’t denying the existence of water in identifying it with H2O, so the materialist isn’t denying the existence of the mental in identifying it with physical entities. Although there may be some tendency on the part of materialists to be dismissive of certain features of the psychological realm, they don’t have to be thus dismissive: Chomsky is a materialist, as was Freud—and those two were nothing if not great believers in the psyche. Advocates of (2) typically (but not universally) hold that mental entities are identical with brain-events and brain-structures. For obvious reasons, they don’t usually hold that mental entities are identical with trees or rocks or anything else that is not a part of one’s body (or, more specifically, one’s central nervous system). I have published some papers arguing for dualism. I am now a materialist. But I am still fundamentally open on this issue. Here are my own views. I believe (as I just said) that materialism is correct. Second, I believe (very strongly) that functionalism (a very popular form of materialism: to be defined later) is wrong. Third, although I believe that materialism is correct, I don’t think (paradoxical though it may sound initially) that it can ever be explained why the mental is identical with (some aspects of) the physical. Right now, let us focus on some of the basic arguments for and against (1). (In the process of discussing these arguments, we will find that there are different versions of both materialism and dualism.) Of course, since (1) is the negation of (2), any argument for (1) is an argument against (2), and any argument for (2) is an argument against (1). 2.0 Two arguments for dualism Setting aside arguments that are...",

    "text": "Evaluating this argument: My own personal view is that this argument is pretty solid; that being why I am a materialist. Others have responded (or, given their positions, would respond) differently to this argument. For example, according to epiphenomenalism, even though the physical affects the mental, the mental does not affect the physical. But epiphenomenalism is clearly wrong. It’s an empirical datum that the mental affects the physical and vice versa. Should it be denied that this is a datum, or even that it’s true, I would respond by showing that epiphenomenalism is at odds with a fundamental fact about the nature of causation. Causation is bidirectional. If my hand affects the table (e.g., if my hand pushes the table), then the table affects my hand. So if, as the epiphenomenalist believes, the physical affected the mental, then the mental would affect the physical. But in that case, epiphenomenalism is false. The epiphenomenalist might counter-respond by saying that there are exceptions to the principle of bi-directionality that I’ve been advocating: physical situations create, and have effects on, shadows; but shadows don’t have effects on anything. But this move is a non-starter. Mental entities, unlike shadows, really do have causal powers. Even the epiphenomenalist doesn’t deny that they affect one another. Given this fact, along with the fact mental events result from physical events, it follows that some of the energy associated with physical states of affairs is transferred to them. So unless energy is implausibly assumed to vanish from the physical world, never to return, we must assume that the mental can, so to speak, spit it back into the physical world and, therefore, that the mental can affect the physical.[408] And, as we’ve seen, once it is granted the mental can affect the physical, it must be granted that the mental is physical. 5.1.1 Another argument for materialism As we’ve seen, the mental clearly affects the physical. If mental entities are subject to physical laws, they are ipso facto physical. (After all, what would it be to be physical, if not to obey physical laws?) And if something obeys physical laws, it is ipso facto physical. What would it mean to say “X obeys the laws of physics —but it isn’t physical”? X is physical iff X obeys physical laws. Thus, if mental entities are not physical, they are not subject to physical laws. So if mental entities were...",

What is there to be physical other than being able to displace mass-energy (or whatever it is that events consist of)? 5.2.1 Evaluating this argument I personally find this argument compelling, and have yet to hear a cogent response to it. 6.0 The Problems with dual aspect theory, idealism, and eliminativism Supposing that the mental and the physical are two aspects of the same thing, we must ask: what is that thing?[412] It can’t be mental; for surely the mental is not an aspect of the mental. (My belief that snow is white is not an aspect of itself or of any other mental thing.) And it can’t be physical; for surely the physical is not an aspect of the physical. (The chair is not an aspect of itself or of any other physical thing.) So (3) is either incoherent or it presupposes that there is something spatiotemporal that is not either physical or mental. But it is incoherent to suppose that there is anything spatiotemporal that is not either mental or physical. It follows that (3) is simply incoherent. It seems to me that so-called “dual aspect” theorists are really just materialists who have misstated their view. So far as that’s correct, we can forget about (3), and focus on (2). And since we’ve already discussed (2), we can move on to (4). (4) is obviously a non-starter. But, for what extremely little it’s worth, here’s the argument behind it. Scientific hypotheses are supposed to deal with things that can be publicly verified. Suppose that scientist Smith insisted that he, and he alone, were able to see (or otherwise sense-perceive) the data that confirmed some hypothesis of his. Obviously Smith wouldn’t be taken seriously. My pains, tickles, etc., cannot be witnessed by anyone other than myself. For this reason, some psychologists who were attempting to scientize their discipline said that such things had no place within science and therefore had no place in a scientific world-view. Given this position, it is a short step to saying that pains, tickles, etc., don’t exist at all. In a word, science deals with what is objective; mental states are subjective; therefore, mental states don’t exist. There are many fallacies in this argument. One of them is that, in actuality, the existence of pains, tickles, etc., is...",

If M is any mental category, P is an instance of M just in case P is a disposition on the part of some individual to respond with certain overt behaviors to certain sensory inputs. Behaviorism is false. How a person reacts to a given sensory input is a function, not only of what that input is, but also of what that person’s existing mental states are. If you don’t speak English, an utterance of “what is 1 + 1?” will not cause you to say “2.” It is only in people who have various pieces of background knowledge (e.g., knowledge of linguistic conventions) that such a disposition corresponds to the knowledge that 1 + 1 = 2. What we said about that particular disposition is true (mutatis mutandis) of any other. By itself, no disposition to engage in a certain kind of overt behavior, given certain stimuli, corresponds to any mental state: what does so is such a disposition plus various pre-existing mental states. So, mental states cannot be reduced to behavioral dispositions. At most, they can be reduced to behavioral dispositions plus various mental states. But this means that they can’t be reduced to behavioral dispositions. Aware of these problems with behaviorism, but still wanting to holding onto the idea that mental entities could be dispositionalized (identified with tendencies to respond with certain overt behaviors to certain inputs), many philosophers of mind responded to this by adopting functionalism, which we’ve already discussed and will now discuss further.",

We can recognize those differences. So our thinking is not syntax-driven. So CTM is wrong. Here is a similar line of thought. If, on July 1, 2010, in Richmond, VA, I say: (i) \"right now, Jim is three thousand miles from here,\" the information encoded in my utterance is very different that encoded in an utterances of: (ii) \"On July 1, 2010, Jim is 3,000 miles from Richmond VA.\" The information encoded in (i) doesn't follow from the information encoded in (ii), or vice versa. In general, when the context-sensitive expressions in a true statement are replaced with context-insensitive expressions, the result is a statement that, although true, neither entails the first statement nor follows from it. For an expression to be context-sensitive is for its referent to vary with the context. What an expression refers to is determined by its semantics, not its syntax. CTM says that thought is to no degree semantics-driven. If that were true, we couldn't grasp perspectival truths, such as that expressed by (i). Since we can grasp such truths, CTM is false. 5.0 CTM’s reliance on the erroneous assumption that there are minimal units of thought First a definition: a “morpheme” is an expression that cannot be decomposed into others. Bearing this in mind, let’s suppose that, just as CTM says, we think in a language. In that case, our concepts are identical with expressions. Linguistic expressions consist of morphemes. (Any given complex expression; e.g., “the cat is on the mat,” decomposes into expressions that cannot, in their turn, be further decomposed; (e.g., “cat,” “mat”). So in contending that our thoughts are identical with (tokens of) Mentalese symbols, CTM is, in effect, assuming that we have simple concepts: concepts that cannot be decomposed in others. So CTM, if correct, entails that any given thought that one has can be decomposed into “simple” concepts. CTM thus has the radically implausible consequence that we have “simple” concepts. In other words, CTM has the consequence that some of our concepts are no more capable of being decomposed into other concepts than a morpheme (e.g., the word “cat”) can be decomposed into other expressions....",

We refer to scooters of a certain kind as “rascals.” But they’re not really rascals. (A rascal is a mischievous young person.) I also think that our tendency to describe (brain-)dead bodies as “people” has emotional roots. At some level, we are holding onto the idea that, deep within that ravaged body, is a mind. In any case, the present author puts no stock in arguments such as (1)–(4). 4.1 A better argument for the physicalistic view But there is a much better argument for the physicalistic conception of personal identity. A story will help us state this argument. Smith is a normal adult with a vigorous mind. One day he’s hit by a bus. There is a complete cessation of all mental activity. Smith’s stream of mental activity has been snipped. But Smith’s body doesn’t die. It goes into a vegetative coma for 20 years. During that time, there is no mental activity at all in what was once Smith’s brain. The brain centers regulating automatic functions (e.g., respiration, digestion) work just fine, but the parts involved in mental activity are totally inactive. No thoughts, no dreams, no sensations. Nothing. After 20 years, the body wakes up, and the hitherto inactive brain centers spring back to life. The occupant of that body is obviously in complete command of his faculties. His personality traits are just like those of the pre-accident occupant of that same body, as are the values, the memories, the cognitive aptitudes, and so on. Let X be the person who occupied that body before the accident and let Y be the person who’s been occupying it since the accident. Is X the same person as Y? Is the post-coma person Smith? Or is it somebody who is psychologically a lot like Smith, but isn’t actually him? Surely it really is Smith. That’s what we’d say, anyway. It’s very hard to believe that Y is a brand-new person (albeit one who has the psychological characteristics ordinarily had only by adults).

Consider, for example, your ability to speak English. Presumably, that ability is constituted by some brain-structure. The neurons (or whatever) that, in their turn, constitute that structure are, in their turn, constituted by (I'm skipping some intermediate levels of description) minute displacements of mass-energy. Those displacements are not themselves mental, even though, ultimately, they're mind-constitutive. (No contradiction here: the atoms that compose cells are not themselves biological entities, even though those cells are such entities.) In connection with your question about mental structures, you make an important point that, if correct, undermines much of what I say but that, I will now try show, is not correct. (In what follows, I’ll use the word “thing” in the narrowest possible sense. So, as I’ll be using it, rocks, apples, and trees are “things,” but neither non-spatiotemporal entities, e.g. possibilities, nor spatiotemporal but intangible entities, e.g. gravitational fields, qualify as “things.”) Just as you say, my position is that events are the ultimate constituents of the spatiotemporal world and, therefore, that: (i) Although there could be events in the absence of things, there couldn't be things in the absence of events. Your position is that things (substances), not events, are the ultimate constituents of the spatiotemporal world and, therefore, that: (ii) Although there could be things in the absence of events, there couldn't be events in the absence of events. The first question to ask is: what do you believe “things” to be? There are three possibilities: (a) Things consist entirely of property-instances. Consider the rock’s weight, shape, color, etc. There is nothing underlying those property instances; there are just the property instances.",

In that case, underlying a given rock’s shape, mass, color, position, etc., there is something that has no shape, mass, color, etc., i.e. there is something that, although it underlies properties, is itself featureless. A featureless thing is a surd. Nothing can have no properties. Thus, both (b) and (c) are false. So (a) must correct. But if (a) is right, then events are the most basic constituents of spatiotemporal world. Here’s why. First of all, for an event to occur is for some property to either come to be instantiated or to cease to be instantiated. (In this context, “property” is short for “property or multiplicity of properties.”) There would be no events if there were no changes, and there would be no changes if there were no cases of properties coming or ceasing to be instantiated. Further, there would be no passage of time if there were no events. To say that it's been a year since you've seen Smith is to say that certain periodic processes have happened a certain number of times since you last saw Smith. Thus, period during which absolutely nothing happens cannot possibly last for more than an instant. It follows that any case of a property-instance's existing for a non-null period of time is parasitic on cases of change and, therefore, on events. Since, as we’ve established, “things” are wholly constituted by property-instances, it follows that any case of a thing’s enduring for more than instant is parasitic on the existence of change. The concept of a thing that exists for no more than an instant is incoherent. Things necessarily consist of property-instances, as we’ve seen. So a thing’s existing for a mere instant would involve there being some property P such that, within a time-interval of zero duration, P came to be and also ceased to be instantiated. Those events, involving as they do the very same property-instance, cannot possibly be simultaneous. So the sequence consisting of those two events would necessarily occupy a time-interval that was greater than an instant. Thus, there could not possibly be a thing that existed for just one instant. Since, as we saw a moment ago, any case of a thing’s enduring for more than instant is parasitic on the existence of change, it follows that changes, or events, are the most fundamental...",

If 4-D is right, the thing that is reading this sentence right now isn’t you; it’s just some time-slice of you. And the slightly different thing that was reading the first sentence of this chapter isn’t you either; it’s just another time-slice of you. The same is true of the thing that decided to buy this book a few weeks ago. According to 4-D, although the thing reading this sentence is different in some ways from the thing that was reading the first sentence of this chapter, those differences aren’t expressions of the fact that some one thing has changed. According to 4-D, you don’t change. For a given object to change is for the way that object is at one time to be different from the way it is at some other time. According to 4­D, for any time t, what exists at t isn’t an object, and is only some “time-slice” of an object. Therefore, there are no two moments of time t and t* such that how some one object is at t is different from how that same object is at t*. Therefore, if 4-D is right, things don’t change. But this is absurd. Things change. I have changed, and so have you. And each of us will continue to change. 4-D is either dead wrong or it amounts to nothing more than a proposal that we use the words “thing” and “change” in non-standard ways. And even if by some remote chance it turns out that things don’t change, it would be bad methodology to make our theory of personal identity depend on that turning out to be the case. In doing so, we’d be assuming facts (or non-facts, rather) that aren’t yet in evidence. Assuming, as we probably must, that things change, the only way to go is to say that identity, in the diachronic sense, is to be understood in terms of relations of causal connectedness—that statements like “Bill is the guy in the photo who is wearing a rugby shirt” are to be analyzed in the way described earlier.

    "text": "There are two ways to interpret this. On the one hand, Hume could be saying that selves don’t exist. On the other, he could be saying that selves are constituted by the thoughts, feelings, etc., that we describe them as “having.” The right interpretation is the second one. Notice how frequently the word “I” occurs in his argument. He obviously believes that, when he uses that word, he's referring to himself and thus to his self. And surely he's right about this. It seems a truism that, if they refer to anything, tokens of \"I\" refer to selves; and it also seems a truism that tokens of \"I\" do refer. Also, in other parts of the Treatise, Hume talks at length about the relation that two different mental contents must bear to each other to belong to the same mind or self. Thus, Hume’s position is that, although selves do exist, they are no more distinct from the mental events that occupy them than a swarm of wasps exists independently of the wasps that compose it. For an event to occupy a mind is for it to constitute it. The just-quoted argument, it will be noticed, is empirical. Hume is arguing on observational, as opposed to strictly logical or conceptual, grounds that there isn’t anything that underlies his various thoughts. When he looks inward, he finds thoughts and nothing else; in particular, he doesn’t find a non-thought that “supports” these various thoughts. This fact is important, as we’ll now see. 6.1.3 Problems with Hume’s argument Given only that we can’t observe something, it doesn’t follow that it doesn’t exist. There are many unobservable entities (e.g., electrons). If Freud (1915) is right, there are unobservable (unintrospectible) mental entities (e.g., unconscious urges). Saying that selves don’t exist since we can’t introspect them is like saying that electrons don’t exist since we can’t see them. A related possibility that Hume is ignoring is that minds are structures of the kind described earlier. (This oversight is probably deliberate, as we’ll see in a moment.) He’s also ignoring the correlative possibility that specific mental occurrences (e.g., images, tickles) are products of minds, and are not themselves constitutive of them. In ignoring these possibilities, Hume is stacking the deck in his favor. We are pretheoretically inclined to see minds as being to specific tickles, itches etc., what car factories are to cars.

    "text": "This argument, unlike the first, isn’t empirical at all. This time, Hume is trying to show on purely conceptual grounds that there is nothing underlying the various events occupying a person’s mind. He’s arguing that the very idea of such a thing is an incoherent one, like that of a square circle. Why is this idea incoherent? Because, says Hume, it has the absurd consequence that there could be thought-free minds. 6.2.2 Evaluating this argument: Hume’s failure to distinguish between two very different meanings of the word “thought” Hume is right that if there is some inner flame underlying one’s thoughts, and therefore distinct from them, it does follow that one’s self could exist in a thought-free condition. But Hume is wrong to say that a thought-free self is an absurdity. The reason Hume thinks it absurd is that he fails to distinguish two very different meanings of the word “thought.” Sometimes the word “thought” refers to mental occurrences—to what are now known as occurrent mental phenomena. An occurrent mental phenomenon is anything mental that happens. Sense-perceptions are occurrent mental phenomena; and so are acts of ratiocination and emotional epiphanies. (This list is far from complete.) But sometimes the word “thought” refers to the relatively stable structures that underlie mental occurrences. “For the first twenty years of my academic career,” a philosopher once said to me, “I thought that Platonism was false.” This person was describing a stable, structural constituent of his mind, not a mental happening. If, by “thought” Hume means “mental happening” then, contrary to what he alleges, there’s nothing incoherent in the idea of a mind that, during some period, isn’t populated by thoughts. If by “thought” Hume means “stable mental structure” then Hume is right to say that there couldn’t be thought-free minds. Earlier, we saw why this is so. If selves were distinct from their thoughts, there could be thought-free minds. So, given that there cannot be thought-free minds, selves are constituted by the thoughts that belong to them. So, after a fashion, Hume is right. Just as he says, there is nothing to one’s self other than the thoughts one has. But this claim of his isn’t right in the way he thought it was. He thought that one’s self consists of the thoughts (i.e., fleeting mental occurrences) that occupy it, and not of the thoughts (i.e., stable structures that create and regulate such...",

In actuality, they are questions of logic, not of empirical fact. Moreover, each of (a)–(c) is logically false and therefore couldn’t possibly be correct. Let’s discuss (a) first. In this chapter, we have seen that anything that persists for any amount of time is a causal series. A causal series is a continuous series of states of affairs such that, given any two of them, one is the (in)direct cause of the other. An illustration may be helpful. At any given moment during its existence, your car consists of an incessant flurry of mass-energy displacements; and your car is thus a series of “event-flurries,” as we’ll call them. Twenty-four hours ago, your car was constituted by one event-flurry. Right now it’s constituted by a different event-flurry. (Let S1 be the first event-flurry and let S2 be the second.) And, of course, my car is currently constituted by some event-flurry. (Let S3 be that flurry.) Bearing all of this in mind, imagine the following. While your car was parked in your driveway, somebody crashed into it, severely damaging it. Your car therefore bears little resemblance to what it was twenty-four hours ago. It follows that S1 and S2 are qualitatively very different from each other. By contrast, S1 and S3 are as similar to each other as their being in different places permits. This is sheer coincidence: S1 and S3 are, we will suppose, as causally disconnected from each other as any two non-simultaneous events on this planet can be. It follows that my car, as it is right now, is just like your car, as it was twenty-four hours ago, before it was damaged. It also follows that S1 is much less similar to S2 than it is to S3. Be all of this as it may, the car in your driveway is, whereas the car in my driveway is not, numerically identical with the car you owned twenty-four hours ago. Mediating between S1 and S2 is a continuous series of events such that, given any two of them, one is the (in)direct cause of the other. No such series mediates between S1 and S3.

Therefore, (i) is false. To see why (ii) is false we need do little more than repeat some of the points just made. Suppose that Smith travels from 2009 to 2023 at a rate of one million minutes/minute. We’ve just seen that Smith cannot make this journey in a discontinuous manner; he cannot disappear from one time and reappear at some other, non-adjacent time. So Smith must make this journey in a continuous manner. So at any given moment during this interval, Smith must be in some place or other. It follows, as we saw a moment ago, that he is no more time-traveling than anything else that exists during that interval. The supposition that Smith is traveling forward in time at a rate of one million minutes/minute thus turns out to collapse into the supposition that he isn’t time-traveling at all. Given any positive number n, an analogous argument shows that continuous forward time-travel at a rate of n minutes/minute collapses into forward time-travel at a rate of one minute/minute. There is another, quite different problem with the concept of discontinuous time-travel. Let W1 be a universe where (i) is true and (ii) is false; and let W2 be an otherwise indistinguishable universe where (ii) is true and (i) is false. What happens in the one universe at any given time coincides with what happens in the other universe at that time. It follows that, even if (per impossibile) an occupant of the one universe knew exactly what happened in that universe at any given time, he would not, in virtue of that fact, have any legitimate reason for preferring (i) to (ii). A fortiori, no possible observation that one might have would provide one with any reason for believing oneself to be in W1 as opposed to W2. Since observation couldn’t possibly provide one with such a reason, only logic could do so. But logic cannot do so, since (i) is logically false, as we’ve already seen.[432]",

    "text": "Similar points hold in connection with discontinuous backwards time­ travel. In the movie Back to the Future, young Marty McFly vanishes from the year 1985 and shows up in the year 1955. This means that, in the year 1985, the causal sequence that constitutes his existence is severed. Like everything else that persists for any length of time, Marty McFly is a causal sequence. It follows that, so far as it isn’t incoherent, the statement: (1) In 1985, Marty McFly traveled backwards in time to the year 1955 and is otherwise unchanged. collapses into: (2) Marty McFly was annihilated in 1985, and in 1955 there appears ex nihilo somebody who is numerically distinct from him but otherwise just like him. Also, given obvious adaptations of what we said a moment ago, there is no conceivable event that, were it known, would provide more support for (1) than for (2). Since, therefore, there couldn’t possibly be any observation-based reason for preferring (1) to (2), the only possible reasons for doing so would be of a logical nature. This means that there are no reasons for doing so, given that (1) is incoherent. The concept of discontinuous backwards time-travel is therefore a broken one. What about the idea of continuous backwards time-travel? For argument’s sake, let’s suppose that, during his continuous journey from the year 1985 to the year 1955, Marty McFly is right next to some stop-sign that was built in 1920 and stays in the same place for several centuries. That means that, at any given moment during that thirty year period, Marty McFly is no more time-traveling than the stop-sign. Each is just sitting there. There are, of course, some important differences between Mary McFly and the stop-sign. First of all, whereas the stop-sign is crushed or burnt or otherwise destroyed in some pedestrian way, Marty McFly must simply vanish in the year 1985. (If he doesn’t, then he’s still hanging around in the year 1985, in which case he obviously hasn’t gone back in time.) And, whereas the stop-sign’s presence in the year 1955 is to be explained in the customary way, Marty McFly just popped up ex nihilo. Bearing these points in mind, let W3 be a universe in which: (3) Marty McFly continuously traveled backwards in time from the year 1985 to the year 1955 but is otherwise unchanged. is true, and in which (2) is...",

    "text": "We must also take into account that, at least according to some viewpoints, the choices we make have extremely deep roots in our unconscious mental lives. Analysis tends to suggest that decisions that seem, at the level of consciousness, to be “random” are, in fact, strictly determined by unconscious forces. In any case, this is one point of view, and it is one for which there is some corroboration. But suppose, if only for argument’s sake, that your choices were not fixed by the state of the universe prior to their occurrence. For the reasons given earlier, that wouldn’t make those choices be free. On the contrary, it would make them more like fits or seizures than like considered, freely made judgments. A story similar to the one just told may help make this clear. You are a student at State University. You have an A-average. All of a sudden, you choose to drop out of college and become a drug dealer. Your choice was not caused to occur by anything; the state of your personality prior to the choice had nothing to do with your making it, and neither did the state of the universe. It just happened. So, in the middle of a test, you throw down your pen, bolt out of the room, and get to work as a drug dealer. Does this sound like a freely made choice? No. It sounds more like a compulsion. It’s as though you were “taken over” by another person and lost control of your body. Again, we see that indeterminism doesn’t help freedom and actually undermines it. 4.0 The Compatibilist Conception of Freedom The problem is that, as we saw, determinism also seems to threaten freedom. Obviously you have no control over the past. If determinism is right, then what happened in the past completely determines exactly what’s happening in the present and, in particular, completely fixes what choices you’re making now. So something over which you have no control is completely responsible for the choices that you’re making. It’s hard to see how, under these circumstances, you could be said to have free will. Nonetheless, some hold that there can be free will in a deterministic world. Such people are known as compatibilists. Those who deny it are incompatibilists. 4.1 The crude form of compatibilism There are ultimately two different forms of compatibilism. One of these is very straightforward;...",

A story will clarify these points. On Monday, you undergo hypnosis. You do so because you believe that it will help you kick your addiction to nicotine. While under hypnosis, the hypnotist, who is a prankster and loves to abuse the power he has over his subjects, tells you that, on Wednesday, you should choose to put on a tin-foil hat, go into your boss’s office, and tell him that aliens are about take over the Earth. On Wednesday, you choose to do these things. So you voluntarily put on a tin-foil hat, etc. Your act was voluntary. You chose to do it. But was it free? My opinion: there was a sense in which it was free, but there was also an important sense in which it was not free. You are not, by virtue of choosing to engage in this odd behavior, in the same category as somebody who wants to walk to his car but is physically restrained. But, for reasons that are not immediately obvious but that we will now try to elucidate, your behavior is either unfree or free only in some attenuated sense. One way of interpreting what Chisholm is saying is as follows[442]: (CR) There is only one significant difference between, on the one hand, your voluntary decision to don a tin-foil hat, etc. and, on the other hand, a ‘normal’ decision (e.g., a decision to play tennis made by somebody whose choice isn’t the result of hypnotic suggestion or any other comparable event). The difference in question is that, whereas your decision was implanted in you by some sentient being, the tennis-player’s decision was implanted in him by impersonal forces. But does that really make a difference? To be sure, your decision (to put on a tin-foil hat, etc.) is the result of malfeasance on somebody’s part, whereas the tennis-player’s decision is not. So, from a moral perspective, there are important differences between the two situations. But, when evaluating whether a person’s decision to do X is free, what is relevant is whether that person had control over the forces leading to that decision;...",

It's inevitable that I will choose to have a meal in the next 12 hours; but that doesn't mean that my decision to eat isn't free. Rational people freely but inevitably choose to act in certain ways. Here’s a case of Smith’s being compelled to behave in a certain way. A very strong person takes hold of Smith’s arms and, despite Smith’s valiant resistance, makes Smith hit himself with his own hands (or, what is probably a more accurate way of putting it, hits Smith with Smith’s own hands). Why is it that, in this case, Smith’s behavior is the result of compulsion? Because the immediate causes of that behavior were not Smith-internal. The forces that led to Smith’s arm-movements were not constitutive of Smith; they failed to be Smith-constitutive even in the attenuated sense in which an impulse is constitutive of a person of a person who regards that impulse as having no value, having thus made every effort to dissociate himself from it, and to which he therefore gives no weight when making decisions. Even though (2) is to the effect that it is compulsory that Smith come into existence and, in due course, do such and such, (2) is quite consistent with Smith’s never being compelled in any way. For (2) is consistent with the proposition that the thing that is being compelled is the universe, not Smith, and that what the universe is being compelled to do is to produce a being, namely Smith, who will decide at t* to go jogging, and whose decision to do so, having for its proximal cause a conglomerate of Smith-constitutive forces, is not compelled---at least not in the sense in which, in the other story, Smith was compelled to hit himself and, indeed, not in any ordinary sense of...",

It’s well known that, if they are to come out correct, counterfactuals typically have to be hedged with ceteris paribus clauses. Even though: (JFK) “If JFK hadn’t been assassinated, he would have been re-elected,” is a plausible counterfactual, it isn’t necessarily true. What if, sometime after Nov. 22, 1963, but before the ‘64 elections, JFK died of natural causes or was disgraced by some scandal? In that case, he would not have been re­elected. So the right counterfactual is: (JFK*) “If JFK hadn’t been assassinated, then ceteris paribus he would have been re-elected.” In other words, if JFK hadn’t been assassinated, but otherwise things were the same, so that JFK was healthy and popular, etc., then he would have been re-elected.[447]",

    "text": "Notice that JFK* is really a causal claim, since it’s just another way of saying: (JFK#) “JFK’s being assassinated caused an otherwise re-election-bound JFK to not be re-elected.” As a rule, counterfactuals are causal claims.[448] Thus, “Smith killed Jones freely” is true just in case (i) Smith killed Jones and (ii) if Smith had chosen not to kill Jones, then ceteris paribus Smith would have not killed Jones. Basically, Smith killed Jones freely if his doing so expressed his decision to do so, as opposed to some other force. In general: (FA)[449] an act is free if it expresses one’s decision to act that way. This is clearly the right analysis of a kind of freedom or---what may be a more accurate way of putting it---a certain aspect of freedom. 4.1.7 Freedom not a property of choices If FA is right, acts are free, not choices. This is what Locke held. Locke was the first advocate of FA, and he was an exceptionally effective one. One chooses to act, Locke said; one doesn’t choose to choose. It makes no sense to suppose that one chooses to choose. For if one always chose what to choose, Locke points out, one would have to make infinitely many choices in order to make a single one, and one therefore couldn’t make any choices at all. In order to choose to open the door, one would have to choose to choose to open the door; and in order to choose to choose to open the door, one would have to choose to choose to choose to open the door; and so on. So freedom is freedom to act, not freedom to choose. As Locke puts it, freedom is a relationship between choice and act, and not between subject and choice. It follows that, so far as one’s freedom is concerned, it is irrelevant whether one’s choices are caused or not. Since freedom is a relationship between choices and acts, not between choices and their own antecedents, it doesn’t matter whether choices are caused. Nor, therefore, does it matter how they’re caused. In fact, if FA is right, determinism is not only compatible with freedom, but is a prerequisite for it.

    "text": "According to Locke, you are free to the extent that you can do what you want to do, and you are unfree to the extent that you cannot. This is obviously a kind of freedom—a very important kind. But it isn’t the only kind. Contrary to what Locke says, there is a sense in which choices can be free or unfree. Harry Frankfurt made this clear.[451] A story will help us begin to understand Frankfurt’s insightful analysis of freedom. Jones is a great writer who is addicted to heroin. Because his addiction is only moderate, he is able to function perfectly well even when he is heroin-deprived. (When heroin-deprived, he doesn’t feel good, but he is in no way incapacitated.) He knows that, if he were to shoot up right now, the subsequent lethargy would make it impossible for him to write a single word for the rest of the day. He also knows that, if he doesn’t write 10 pages today, he will lose his book contract. Jones does not want to lose the contract. Plus, he wants to grow as a writer, which he won’t do, at least not today, if he shoots up. He thus has a desire to not take the heroin—even though he simultaneously has a desire to take the heroin. Jones’ desire to take heroin is a first-order desire. Jones’ desire not to act on this desire is a second-order desire. This is because Jones’ desire not to take heroin is a desire as to what to do with another desire; it is a desire not to cave in to a desire to take heroin. Suppose that Jones caves in and he takes the heroin. In that case, Jones is a slave to his desires. His will has been compromised. He is not acting freely. But now suppose that Jones does not cave in. He does the right thing: instead of taking the heroin, he endures the discomfort of a heroin-free day and manages to get his work done. In this context, Jones is not a slave to his desires. His will has not been bent. His conduct expresses a “free will.” In light of considerations such as these, Frankfurt says that somebody has a free will to the extent that his conduct aligns with his second-order desires. But here a question arises. Why are second-order desires so special? Why is it that freedom...",

    "text": "Having distinguished between rational conduct and intelligent, we may proceed with our discussion of Frankfurt’s analysis of freedom. 5.01 Frankfurt’s analysis of freedom (continued) There’s more to being free than being able to do what you want to do. Your desires must reflect who you are. If they don’t, those desires belong to you but aren’t of you. And in that case, you are alienated from your own mental states, in much the way that a person with Parkinson’s is alienated from his body. But, in a way, the alienation is even worse. Involuntary behavior is unintentional behavior. Intentional behavior is voluntary behavior. Voluntary behavior is desire-driven behavior. (If you don’t want to raise your arm, but it goes up anyway, you didn’t intend for it to happen.) Epileptic fits are not actions. Unintended behaviors are not actions. Unlike actions, they’re undergone, not done. So estrangement from one’s own actions amounts to estrangement from all of one’s own desires; and it’s hard to imagine a condition less free than that. 5.1 Frankfurt’s emendation of this analysis Another story will help expose a problem with the analysis of freedom just described, and it will also clarify the raison d’être for Frankfurt’s soon to be discussed emendations of it. Smith’s first-order desires are seriously out of alignment with his second. He values writing poetry; he’s good at it; and he enjoys it about as much as it’s humanly possible to enjoy it. But he has a voracious craving for drugs. His craving for drugs, especially cocaine, is unusually strong; and his desire to write poetry, though intense, is not as intense as his desire to do cocaine. Smith’s desire to do cocaine is out of alignment with many of his values (second-order desires). Were he to give into this desire, he couldn’t write poetry; nor could he maintain friendships or play sports or, with only a few exceptions, do any of the other things he values. For this reason, he doesn’t give in. But given how intense his craving is, every day is a struggle for Smith. If, as Frankfurt suggests, one is free to the extent that one acts on one’s second-order desires, Smith is as free as a person can be. But given how hard life is for Smith, it’s counterintuitive to suppose that he’s maximally free. To be sure he has a kind of freedom, and he has it...",

    "text": "So, in deferring to the senior professor, Green isn’t acting according to his second order desires. Rather, he’s acting according to what he’s deluded himself into believing are his second order desires. (Consequently, the fact that Green’s actions are not free, except in the sense that they’re voluntary, is consistent with Frankfurt’s analysis.) (iii) Situations such as those described by GR neither constitute cases where one set of higher-order values is replaced with another nor constitute cases where some new set of higher-order values has altogether failed to have been installed. Rather, such situations involve a bifurcation or fracturing of the psyche--­a kind of splitting of oneself into two selves, one of which still has the old set of values and the other of which has the new set of values. So, according to this hypothesis, rationalizations do install new higher-order desires. Contrary to (iii), however, they do so, not by ousting old higher-order desires, but by adding new ones to them. Given that the new ones are inconsistent with the old ones, rationalization necessarily involves a degradation of one’s psychological integrity. One’s thinking must become more illogical than it used to be or one’s agency---by which I mean the totality of faculties involved in one’s being able to decide what to do---must undergo a sort of splitting. (iv) Although second-order values can be uninstalled and replaced with others, a distinction must be made between higher-order values, on the one hand, and core values, on the other. All core values are higher-order values, but not all higher-order values are core values. Green’s actions are unfree because, although they’re consistent with (some of) his higher-order values, they aren’t consistent with his core values. 2.1 Free acts = value-driven acts (i) is out of the question. To say that people don’t rationalize is itself to rationalize, given what an obvious empirical fact it is that people rationalize. Also, the essence of Frankfurt’s position is that, if one is to be free, one must not be at war with oneself: intrapsychic conflict is the enemy of freedom. Frankfurt is aware that there are different ways of eliminating intrapsychic conflict and that some of them not only fail to bring one freedom but strip one of it. For example, given somebody who is torn between shooting heroin and kicking his addiction, that person can cease to be at war with himself by relinquishing his...",

But, human psychology being what it is, it seems that self-deception is essential to the perpetuation, if not the initiation, of such conflict. In any case, (i) is prima facie discrepant with empirical facts; and, although many philosophers and psychologists virulently deny (i), they do so on a priori grounds that, as we’ll see, are made of straw or, what is much more common, they don’t bother to defend their position. (ii) is inconsistent with empirical facts. People’s values do change. As a 20 year old, Jim wants to save the world. He works for the Peace Corps. He spends his weekends working at soup kitchens. As a 40 year old, Jim is an investment banker who lives to accumulate wealth and wouldn’t dream of not having a live-in maid, butler, etc. One could say that, even as a 20 year old, Jim’s values were really those of a greedy banker or that, as a 40 year old, his values are really those of a hippie do-gooder. But such a position would be ad hoc and counter-empirical. To be sure, there are many cases where somebody who is in fact a greedy sociopath works at a soup-kitchen (etc.), so as to bolster his resume in the hopes of making a lot of money on Wall St. And there are people who make a lot of money on Wall St. who wish that they were doing good for the world and whose consequent grief all the gin in the world cannot drown out. But there are also people whose values truly change. (iii) describes something that, I suspect, really does happen. But, I also suspect, it does not describe what is typically happening in cases of rationalization. In my personal experience, and in the clinical experience of many an authority, what typically happens is that some one set of higher-order desires becomes corrupt: there is a mixing of the old (pure) higher-order desires with new (corrupt, rationalization-driven) higher-order desires. There is still just one agent. There aren’t two agents—a Dr. Jekyll and a Mr. Hyde—inhabiting one body. There is but one agent. Some of his higher-order desires are wholesome and some of...",

But the relation I bear to that activity by virtue of enjoying it is distinct from the relation that I bear to it by virtue of valuing it. By virtue of the fact that I value playing the piano, I bear a cognitive relation to that activity; in other words, my valuing it consists in my having made a judgment about it (viz., I see it as having value and therefore---for reasons that we’ll soon identify---as being agential). By virtue of the fact that I enjoy playing the piano, I bear a purely affective relation to it (viz., it makes me feel good). 2.3 What are values? A value is a judgment on the part of some person (or sentient creature) to the effect that a certain course of action, or a certain outlook, will increase the scope of its agency. A moment ago I was reading a book (The Scientific Image, by Bas Van Fraassen). I then had a sudden urge to read a different book (The Will to Power, by Nietzsche). I was driven by a whim. Van Fraassen’s book was illuminating; I was not wasting my time by reading it. And, although, for personal and professional reasons, I do at some point have to read Nietzsche’s book (which, judging from the fragments I’ve read, is extremely good), I would, in giving in to my whim to ditch Van Fraassen, be undermining a resolution of mine, and doing so for no good reason. The result of my ditching Van Fraassen under these circumstances would have been a degradation of psychological integrity. I would have been allowing my decision-making process to give undue weight to sudden fancies. I would have been sending a message to myself that it’s ok not to carry out an intention that I had formed in a rational and informed manner and that I knew that, if successfully carried out, would make me a better and more powerful person.

One has no moral obligation to promote what has no moral value. So, one has no moral obligation to promote welfare (agency) unless agency has moral value. A fortiori one's primary moral obligation cannot be to promote other people's welfare unless agency is the most valuable thing. But agency is, of its very nature, something that has only a relative value: relative to me, my agency may well be the most valuable thing. (In fact, I have no doubt that it is.) But relative to you, my agency has no value at all--except in an irrelevant, purely instrumental sense. (All references to \"value\" in this context are to intrinsic, not instrumental, value.) So VS is saying that, ethically, what is worthless to a given individual is the very thing that has the most worth. And I do not see how such a value system could be a coherent one. This suggests that one of the following propositions holds: (i) What is of moral value may not be of the slightest value to any given individual, in which case anyone who acts morally is ipso facto acting irrationally. (In fact, even in cases where what is moral happens to coincide with what is valuable to a given agent, it is not as somebody who is acting morally that he is acting rationally. His behavior, if rational, merely coincides with that of somebody who is genuinely moral. It does not itself embody any morality, being nothing more than a mere simulation of it.)",

An agent is a mind that acts, and doesn’t just react. In order for a mind to be capable of acting, instead of just reacting, that mind must do more than simply facilitate the gratification of primal urges; it must do more than provide the organism with information concerning the external world that makes it clear how, without being killed or injured, that organism can eat, sleep, etc. A mind whose only objectives are to gratify such urges, and in which the sole purpose of knowledge is to enable such urges to be gratified, merely reacts, in light of the knowledge that it has, to the directives of instinct.

And most of the time you are not conscious of it. But it exists, and is operative, even when you are not conscious of it. If you didn’t know that 1 + 1 = 2, then the way in which you dealt with the world---the way in which you transacted with others, as well as the way you dealt with problems not having an interpersonal dimension----would differ radically from the way in which, even when you’re not consciously thinking that 1 + 1 = 2 or a fortiori thinking about your knowledge that 1 + 1 = 2, you in fact deal with the world. The way in which you reason is not only consistent with, but expressive of, a knowledge that 1 + 1 = 2, the same being true of the way in which you interact with people and also of the way in which you manage matters that don’t involve others. But it is only during, at most, a tiny few of the occasions when one’s thoughts and overt acts are guided by a conscious awareness of the fact that 1 + 1 = 2. It is only rarely that one consciously thinks about the fact that 1 + 1 = 2 or, therefore, that one thinks about one’s belief that 1 + 1 = 2. Bearing this in mind, suppose, if only for argument’s sake, that your knowledge that 1 + 1 = 2 is identical with some physiological structure. It follows from what we’ve said that, even when you are not conscious of the fact 1 + 1 = 2, or therefore of your knowledge of that fact, this belief of yours is psychologically operative. Of course, given that it’s a physiological structure, it’s inevitably operative in the same, thought-free way as an involuntary muscle-spasm. But, even when not the object of consciousness, that physiological structure is also psychologically active; it’s active, in other words, as a belief, and not just as a heap of...",

For, at time t, you find out that Ted Jones is the Springfield Strangler. You see him being arrested. You hear the subsequent news reports. You consider various facts directly known to you about Ted Jones: his sudden nightly disappearances, which typically involved Ted’s dragging large trunks to his pick-up truck; the stench emanating from his house, which he implausibly explained by saying that he had a clogged sink; etc. You thus realize that Ted Jones is indeed the Springfield Killer. Just as one can, without knowing it, be acquainted with a given individual while also having descriptive knowledge of it, so one can be acquainted with a given one of one’s own mental contents while also having descriptive knowledge of it. A corollary is that, given some mental entity E that belongs to one, one can discover that one actually has some attitude towards E that one did not previously know oneself to have. You can discover that the gnawing feeling of unpleasantness you experience whenever somebody mentions Smith is your detestation of Smith. Emotions are distinct from their manifestations in consciousness. Your love of your mother (supposing for argument’s sake that she’s alive and that you do love her) is an enduring psychological structure; it is not an ephemeral event. But it gives rise to ephemeral conscious events (to pangs of remorse when you inadvertently hurt her feelings, to surges of joy when, after not hearing from her for three months, she calls you, etc.). But your love for her is not itself a conscious event. It is \"conscious\" only in the Pickwickian sense that you are conscious of it. Beliefs, like emotions, are enduring structures and are to be distinguished from the constituents of consciousness to which they may give rise. All propositional attitudes are enduring structures and are thus to be distinguished from any constituents of consciousness for whose existence they’re responsible. And a given emotion, e.g., your hatred of Smith, can give rise to conscious events of very different kinds. It can give rise to gnawing feelings of unpleasantness (as when you hear that he’s coming over), to intense feelings of satisfaction (as when you hear that he flunked his economics exam), etc. And given two qualitatively distinct conscious events, both of them...",

I know that Jerry is a vicious and prolific murderer. All of a sudden, I see Jerry’s grinning face pressed against my window. The result: I’m afraid. (I wouldn’t have reacted with fear if my pre-existing belief had been to the effect that Jerry was a harmless prankster who, in his attempts to be funny, pressed his grinning face against people’s windows.) Clearly, the information encoded in my knowledge about Jerry is “pooled” with the contents of my sense-perception, that being why I am struck by fear. That pooling occurs without anyone’s engaging in any overt behaviors and, therefore, without anyone’s employing any symbolic intermediaries. The one mental entity’s contents directly merge (if that’s the right word) with the others. The fact that these two bodies of information can merge thus directly is not a consequence of their both belonging to the same mind: it is constitutive of their belonging to the same mind. Two mental entities whose contents are thus related ipso facto both “belong” to some one mind. Of course, there are distinct mental entities that belong to some one mind that are not as directly related to each other as are the two just-mentioned mental entities. For example, none of the mental entities constitutive of my mind in 1987 is related in that way to any given one of my current mental contents. And there are mental entities in my mind right at this very moment that are not thus interrelated. But, given one of those 1987-mental entities, how are its contents pooled with those of a given one of my 2010 mental contents? Through overt behaviors on my (or somebody else’s) part? No. Through symbolic intermediaries? No. The pooling is accomplished via a series of mental states S1…Sn such that S1’s contents directly merge with those of the aforementioned 1987 mental entity, such that Sn’s contents directly merge with those of the aforementioned 2010 mental entity, and such that, for each i, the contents of Si directly merge with those of Si+1....",

    "text": "Rationalizers see the world as they want it to be, not as it is. Thinkers see the world as it is not as they want to be. So people have an incentive both to rationalize and to not think. Also, rationalizing is the path of least resistance. Working for what you want is hard; pretending that you have it is easy. This obviously gives people another incentive both to rationalize and to not think. Also, thinking does, whereas rationalization does not, involve recognizing that one is fallible and, therefore, that the world was not designed to validate one's opinions. Thinking involves subordinating one's mental activities to objective norms. This involves evaluating one's own thoughts and, oftentimes, admitting that they're wrong. Rationalization involves not subordinating one's thoughts to objective norms and not admitting that one is wrong. So the rationalizer's ego is spared the hard knocks that the thinker's ego has to endure. Rationalization is a manifestation of our instinct to flee from danger. Through physical flight, we flee from an external threat; through rationalization, we flee from an internal threat.[482] Thus, a person's tendency to rationalize has deep instinctual roots. For this reason, rationalizing doesn't involve exercising one's agency. In fact, it involves letting sub-agential, instinctual forces triumph over one's agency. So far as one's agency is involved in the construction of a rationalization, it is nothing more than the puppet of sub-agential instincts, its sole function being to make instinct-driven, lapses in self-discipline and rationality appear to oneself to be expressions of rationality and self-control. Of course, everyone rationalizes, even the greatest of thinkers. But to the extent that one’s mental activity mediates rationalization, that activity is sub-agential; and to the extent that one’s mental activity mediates genuine thought, it is agential. These points are conjectural, it must be emphasized. Nonetheless, I wish to end this section with a point that is even more conjectural than those just made. We all know people who are extraordinarily “street smart”, even though their discursive abilities are those of somebody whose level of intelligence is extremely low. Speaking personally, I used to believe that a street smart person was an intelligentwho didn't have the good fortune to receive a decent education; I used to believe that, if a given street smart person had been properly educated, he would be as discursively intelligent as, in actuality, he was street smart.

Interpretation of (iii): The vampire’s face represents the sociopath’s self-concept, and the vampire’s inability to see his own face represents the fact that the sociopath has no endogenous self-concept. Lacking in any real self-concept, sociopaths are empty; there is no life in them. Interpretation of (iv): The fact that only others can see the vampire’s face corresponds to the fact that the sociopath’s self-concept is dependent on the acknowledgement of others. (Sociopaths tend to spent a lot of time in front looking at themselves in the mirror.) Interpretation of (v): The sociopath is empty; he tries to fill the void with external tokens of the success. Also, since can’t distinguish the image from the reality, and wealth creates the image of success, the sociopath equates wealth with success. Interpretation of (vi): Bats are blind.

But this only confirms our point that, if a person genuinely is convinced that what he’s written is good, he doesn’t want adulation per se: what he wants are the benefits that adulation brings with it. Some are likely to reject (i). “If an author knows that what he’s written is good,” it will be said, “he ipso facto cannot possibly be at all insecure about its merits.” This criticism falsely assumes that people cannot have mutually opposed beliefs. The statement “Smith believes that 1+1=2 and Smith does not believe that 1+1=2” is incoherent. But the statement “Smith believes that 1+1=2 and Smith believes that 1+1.2” is perfectly coherent. In fact, the history of ideas is replete with cases of people having incompatible beliefs. In particular, many a great artist (e.g. Brahms) was rightly convinced, in a genuine and non-defense way, of the excellence of his work while being tormented by terrible insecurities about it. People are not cognitively unified. And an author who knows that his work is great can, at some level, believe that his work is bad and, therefore, will find praise for his to work to be a source of comfort.",

    "text": "This reasonable-seeming analysis embodies several confusions. (I should point out that, in his excellent book The Faces of Intention, Michael Bratman makes points similar to, but not coincident with, those that I am about to make.[488]) A desire that is directly converted into overt behavior is a reaction, not an action proper. For a desire to lead to action, it must be inhibited and scrutinized, so as to ensure that it embodies the right values. By virtue of surviving such scrutiny, a desire becomes an intention and, to the extent that circumstances allow, automatically discharges itself in action. Even those desires that are expressed in action despite not surviving such scrutiny are not cases of desires being directly converted into action. They are cases of desires being scrutinized, then found to fall short, but being allowed to discharge themselves anyway. The reason the tobacco-addict feels ashamed is that, despite what his conscience tells him as he’s considering his wish to smoke, he nonetheless lifts the initial inhibition that he has on smoking. And even though, in respect of his overt behavior, he may pounce on the cigarette the way a tiger pounces on red meat, the addict’s behavior is that of somebody in whom the impulse to smoke is the result of a decision: his impulse is initially quarantined, then scrutinized, and only then, despite its falling short of the relevant valuative benchmarks, allowed to be discharged in action. The tiger’s desire, on the other hand, is directly translated into action. Where selves are concerned, few so-called impulsive behaviors, if any, involve a desire’s being directly translated into action; they typically involve cases where there is an initial inhibition which, despite his better judgment, the person in question chooses to lift. That said, the decision to lift the inhibition sometimes is a wise one. The person in question wishes to appear like a violent, unpredictable animal, since he knows that, given the circumstances, this is to his strategic advantage; and he knows that, if he punches the person who just insulted him, that is precisely how he will appear. Many apparently impetuous actions are carefully considered. We must remember that “carefully considered” . “slowly considered.” A carefully considered decision can be made virtually instantaneously. This is partly because we think fast. But it’s primarily because, given previous decisions that we spent a great deal of time making and that we’ve...",

    "text": "Nietzsche infamously argued for a doctrine known as ethical egoism (EE). According to this doctrine, it is one’s sole ethical obligation to promote one’s own welfare. One important desideratum that an ethical theory must satisfy is to say how people should treat others. Obviously EE fails to satisfy this desideratum. Since no viable ethical theory can fail to satisfy this desideratum, EE fails as an ethical theory. But there are desiderata that an ethical theory ought to satisfy and that, unlike every other ethical theory, EE does satisfy. First of all, an ethical theory shouldn’t require people to diminish themselves. The most pure way of being evil towards someone is to diminish them. An ethical theory that diminishes those who follow it is therefore evil. And an ethical theory that is itself evil is ipso facto not a coherent one. Aside from EE, all ethical theories do require people to diminish themselves: they require people to do what others want and need them to do, not what they want and need to do. EE doesn’t require people to diminish themselves. For EE’s sole injunction is: Don’t diminish yourself! EE isn’t evil towards those who follow it. Thus, there is a respect in which EE is coherent and in which all other ethical theories are incoherent. (That said, there are respects in which EE is incoherent and in which most, if not all, other ethical theories are coherent.) There is another important desideratum that EE satisfies and that all other ethical theories fail to satisfy. People are self-centered. People who don’t allow themselves to do what they want to do are frustrated, unhealthy people. (When I talk about “what people want to do,\" I mean what people want to do in so far as what they want to do isn’t the result of cowardice or complacency or otherwise self-diminishing factors. In other words, I am talking about the wishes that people’s selves have, and I am therefore not talking about the craven impulses that, although in people, are not of them---i.e., that, although in people’s minds, are not constitutive of their selves.) One can obey EE faultlessly without jeopardizing one’s psychological health. The same cannot be said of any other ethical theory. All other ethical theories require one to put other people’s interests ahead of one’s own. And, setting aside people who are already severely damaged, nobody can do this unremittingly....",

Thus, Einhorn’s supposed progressiveness was the purest form of regressivism. Because Einhorn was representative in this respect of an entire generation of so-called liberals, people who don’t want to return to a tribal mode of existence are given an incentive to not be liberal, even if they haven’t a conservative bone in their body. I feel that a few remarks about my personal experiences may not be out of order, so long as it’s kept in mind that those remarks may well be nothing more than prejudice-driven interpretations of facts about my life that, even if interpreted dispassionately, would reveal little about the world. I personally have known many leading members of the 1960’s counterculture; a very close relative of mine is one of the two or three best known astrologers in the nation. These particular individuals are among the most ill-willed and intellectually rigid people that I know. And, having attended many functions over which they presided, I have found the same to be true of their followers. For this reason, I suspect that acceptance of 1960’s-style liberalism often has roots in one, or both, of the following factors: (1) A wish to disguise, both from oneself and from others, a virulent, all-consuming ill-will, and: (2) A combination of a rabid desire for power, coupled with a narcissistic unwillingness to put in the work required to achieve success within institutions where they don’t make the rules and where they’ll be subjected to meaningful scrutiny. 6.4.1 Wittgenstein Einhorn was a big Wittgenstein fan. This was no accident. Wittgenstein was a psychopath. A below average student in both high-school and college, he received a PhD from Cambridge without taking any of the standard entrance-exams, without taking a single class, and without writing so much as a single paper, apart from the TLP. He submitted the TLP as his dissertation and, on that basis, was “awarded” a doctorate in Philosophy. Wittgenstein supposedly labored over the TLP. If this is true, his efforts were to no avail. The end result was an absolute failure. It’s maximally obscure, except when what it is saying isn’t trivial or obviously false. No effort is made to clarify the obscure statements or to substantiate them....",

His post-Tractarian work consisted entirely in his blocking off fruitful avenues of inquiry. He insisted, in fact, that any attempt to solve any philosophical problem was ipso facto misguided. In the work in which he made that claim, he said, without ever saying what he meant, that “everything is as it appears” and “there are no mysteries.” He also says, without clarifying what he means, that “the purpose of philosophy is to show the fly the way out of the bottle.” One can see how one could see great depth in such statements. But one could also see how one could project depths into those statements that they don’t have. In fact, there is little, if anything, in Wittgenstein’s work that, when interpreted literally as opposed to projectively, has any meaning at all. Wittgenstein’s native language was German, not English. He never became fluent and always spoke with a heavy accent. This, I suspect, was much of the reason he wasn’t seen for what he was. It immediately disposed people not to take what he was saying at face value, to assume that his obscure utterances bore hidden meanings, and, consequently, to project meanings into words that weren’t there. Wittgenstein spoke little English when he first met Russell. But, even though Russell spoke fluent German, Wittgenstein insisted on speaking English. This is because Wittgenstein knew that, had he spoken in German, Russell would have seen that his failure to say anything meaningful was a result, not of his being unable to articulate his thoughts, but of his not having any. Also, because at that time Wittgenstein's English was so poor and because, as a result, he wasn't saying anything meaningful, Wittgenstein's words were, I more than suspect, a blank a canvass onto which Russell liberally projected his own insights, this being why, despite initially believing Wittgenstein to be an imbecile and a phony, Russell came to see great depths in Wittgenstein's broken sentences. During his lectures, Wittgenstein would pause for unusually long periods of time. During these pauses, his face and bodily movements projected deep pensiveness along with an almost maniacally intense level of concentration. To a large extent, I suspect, these silences were Wittgenstein’s way of avoiding having to say anything and, therewith, of allowing his audience-members to project into his fragmentary speech the very...",

In that work, any gaps in the criticisms of CRS just put forth are very much filled in. Conditional: A conditional statement is one that has the form if P, then Q. Conditional statements play a vital role in logic, since logic is the discipline that attempts to determine what follows from what, and any statement to the effect that one statement follows from another is expressed by a conditional. Confirm: For P to confirm Q is for P to provide support for Q. (P: ‘Smith’s fingerprints are found in the murder-weapon used to kill Jones.’ Q: “Smith killed Jones.” P supports Q.) Confirmation is defeasible, meaning that, even if P confirms Q, some other statement might provide more support for not-Q than P provides for Q. (R: “There is a video-tape of Brown killing Smith, then pressing the hand of Smith, who is at the crime-scene but unconscious, around the murder-weapon, and then leaving it at the scene.”) Entailment is not defeasible. A consequence is that P cannot, if true, entail Q without Q’s being true. See “confirmation.” Confirmation: P confirms Q if, supposing that P is true, it’s possible that Q is false but it’s more likely than not that Q is true. “Smith is a Harvard professor” confirms “Smith is not a complete moron,” but it doesn’t entail it. See “confirm” and “entailment.” Conjunct: In P and Q, each of P and Q is a “conjunct.” So snow is white is one of the conjuncts of snow is white and grass is green. See “conjunction.” Conjunction: A conjunction is any sentence composed of two sentences that are joined by an “and” or a “but” or an “although”—or any other connective whose purpose is to indicate that both of the sentences thereby joined are true. Connective: A “connective” expression is one that, given one or more sentences, enables a new sentence to be formed. So, “if ” is a connective since, given the sentences “grass is green” and “snow is white,” it yields the sentence “if grass is green, then snow is white.” All conjunctions (“and,” “or,” “but”) are connectives. So is “not.” This is because “snow is not white” says the same thing as “it is not the case that snow is white,” which is what results when...",
