    "text": "The misunderstandings that dominate contemporary philosophy of language have crystallized in an argument known as the “Slingshot”. The Slingshot “proves” things that are obviously not true (e.g. that your car is identical with my computer). So we must look for errors in it. These are not hard to find. Once these errors are exposed, it becomes necessary to rethink and reconstruct many semantic orthodoxies. The purpose of this work is to effect that reconstruction. If cogent, the narrowly semantic arguments given in this work have far-reaching implications. They give us leverage on some perennial issues concerning knowledge and psychological explanation. The present work is divided into two major sections or “volumes”, as I will call them. In the first volume (Chapters 2 through 16, pages XXX-XXX), I defend various semantic claims, the main ones being (i*)-(iv*). That volume will be concerned almost exclusively with semantics. Virtually nothing will be said about epistemology, modality, or psychological explanation. In the second volume (Chapters 17 through 28, pages XXX-XXX), I draw what I believe to be the non-semantic consequences of the narrowly semantic points made in the first part. I discuss how, in light of those narrowly semantic points, we can obtain some insight into various problems relating to a doctrine (or, better, a family of interconnected doctrines) called “externalism”. In connection with this, we will obtain insight into problems relating to epistemology, modality, and psychological explanation. Up to a point, the first volume is an articulation and consolidation of existing views. It will inevitably arouse disagreement. But because of its conservative nature, I don’t think that volume will be particularly controversial. The second volume is a different matter. There I will try to overthrow many orthodoxies of the present day. So the second volume, unlike the first, will arouse fierce and widespread resistance, though I will do my best to mitigate that through argumentation. The second volume will not be sheer iconoclasticism. I will indeed try to overthrow some contemporary orthodoxies. But I will do so by appealing to older and more deeply entrenched ones. So, from some viewpoint, what I say is actually quite conservative. I should point out that, in Volume II, I revisit certain narrowly semantic issues (e.g. whether anaphoric pronouns are bound variables) in order to strengthen the non-semantic points for which I am there arguing. So the two volumes are intertwined in subject-matter. In what remains of...",

    "text": "Frege thought otherwise. He argued that whole sentences refer to things. He held that those things are truth-values. His argument for this conclusion is known as the “Slingshot”. Slingshot-style arguments have been used to prove many things – some of them quite extraordinary. In fact, the Slingshot “proves” things that aren’t true. The Slingshot proves, for example, that your car is identical with Mozart’s favorite wig. The Slingshot doesn’t just prove that sentences refer to truth-values. chapt But even the thesis that they refer to truth-values is, I believe, one that must be rejected, as it conflicts with any viable conception of reference. So instead of accepting the Slingshot, we should look for errors in it. It contains several quite profound errors. There is no way to fix it so that it doesn’t contain those errors. Thus we are not compelled to accept the deliverances of the Slingshot. Given only that the Slingshot “proves” that sentences refer to truth-values, it doesn’t follow that they actually do so refer. So what do they refer to? The short answer is: they refer to propositions. But there a few reasons why the short answer isn’t quite true, even though it is close. First, sentence-types don’t refer to anything: it is sentence-tokens that refer. Second, while a sentence-token does refer to a proposition, that is not all it refers to. A sentence-token refers to a function of a special kind: one that involves, but is not identical with, a proposition. Here we must be careful. Propositions are themselves plausibly analyzed as functions of a certain kind: functions from worlds to truth-values. Not only must we distinguish between tokens and types: we must distinguish between sentence-tokens that have force and those that do not.

    "text": "In general, when a sentence-token is a proper part of another sentence-token, it doesn’t have any kind of force. (There are some dubious exceptions to this; but we can set these aside for now.) I will refer to sentence-tokens not having force as forceless. I will argue that forceless sentence-tokens refer to propositions. Consider an arbitrary token of (**). The occurrence of “Mozart wrote music” picks out a proposition, and the “necessarily” picks out a property of propositions. It is just like a token of “Brutus snores” except that, instead of one expression referring to a person and another referring to a bodily function, we have one expression referring to a proposition and another to a modal status. Consider an arbitrary token of (*). We have two component sentences. Each of these picks out a proposition. And we also have a connective (“if…then…”); this picks out a relation that holds between propositions – a property of propositions (or, if we want to be technical about it, of ordered pairs of propositions). Given any sentence-token that consists of other sentence-tokens, a similar line of thought suggests that the component sentence-tokens refer to propositions. Forceless sentence-tokens refer to propositions. Of course, some sentence-tokens do have force. Consider a token of either (*) or (**). As a whole, that token has force. Let us refer to such tokens as “forced”. What do “forced” sentence-tokens refer to? The short answer is: they refer to propositions – just like their forceless counter-parts. But the short answer isn’t quite right. The referent of a forced sentence-token is a function involving a proposition, but is not identical with a proposition. So the referent of a forced sentence-token is a function involving a function. The meaning of a sentence-type is also a function. But this kind of function is entirely different from the kind that is the referent of a sentence-token. .",

    "text": "Given some uncontroversial principles – principles that are acceptable to Slingshot-friends and foes alike - it is clear that sentence-types don’t refer to anything. They no more refer than the type “you” refers. The sentence-type “I am tired” has a meaning; but its meaning is not a proposition. Its meaning is a function from contexts of utterance to propositions. The meaning of such a token is a proposition. Actually, the meaning of such a token is not just a proposition; more is involved, as we’ll soon see. But for the moment, let us speak approximately – let us say that the thing meant by a sentence-token is a proposition. Sentences containing indexicals have a “two-dimensional” structure. There is what indexical sentence-types mean (functions that assign propositions to sentence-tokens). And there is what indexical sentence-tokens mean (propositions). So, uncontroversially, some sentences have a two-dimensional structure. What about those sentence-types that lack an indexical-component? Perhaps those sentence-types have propositions, not functions, for their meanings. There are two problems with this proposal. First, indexical sentences are the rule, not the exception. All, or almost all, sentences of natural language contain tense-markers and thus indexicals. Second, even if, in natural language, there were non-indexical sentence-types, it would be very strange to suppose that some sentence-types had propositions for their meanings, while others had functions from contexts of utterance to propositions for their meanings. Such a supposition would introduce a massive cleavage into a class that, in all likelihood, is unified. In fact, arguably, it would amount to a redefinition of “sentence”. There would be “sentences1” – expressions that have functions from contexts of utterance to propositions for their meanings. This would comprise all, or nearly all, of the natural-language expressions we refer to as “sentences”. And there would also be “sentences2”: these would be sentence-types that had propositions for their meanings. Sentences1 and Sentences2 are obviously very different sorts of things. It is hard to believe that the class of “sentences” is so heterogeneous – that “I am tired” is in a different category from “2+2=4”. The natural solution is this. Sentence-types uniformly have functions for their meanings: functions from contexts of utterance to propositions. In some cases, it seems as though the sentence-type per se has a proposition for its meaning. But that is an illusion. An analogy might help. “100÷2÷5” is obviously ambiguous.

Even if we are limited to that one operation, we can still reach our destination.

We are not saying that, for all values of x, the condition a thing must satisfy to be picked out by the one expression entails and is entailed by the corresponding condition for the other. “Triangles have three sides” is “logically equivalent” with “1+1=2”. (More exactly, any token of the one is logically equivalent with any token of the other.) What does the term “logically equivalent” mean here? It means that the thing semantically contributed by the one sentence-token entails, and is entailed by, the thing semantically contributed by the other. “Triangles have three sides” means, i.e. semantically contributes, triangles have three sides. “1+1=2” means, i.e. semantically contributes, 1+1=2. The one proposition entails, and is entailed by, the other. Given only that “logically equivalent” noun phrases – e.g. “Plato” and “the unique thing x such that 1+1=2 and x is identical with Plato” -- must co-refer, it does not follow that “logically equivalent” sentence-tokens must co-refer.

    "text": "More on reference Here is another reason to think that sentence-tokens refer to their meanings, not their truth-values. The argument about to be outlined will initially strike many as radically implausible. Bear in mind that what I’m presenting here is just an outline: the argument proper is given in the next section. The meaning of the type “you” is a function, not an individual. The semantic content of a token of “you” is an individual. To understand an utterance is to know its semantic content. You obviously cannot know the semantic content of a token of an indexical, like “you”, unless you know what it refers to. Where indexical-tokens are concerned, semantic content equals referent. If definite descriptions are terms that refer to individuals, then the same thing is true of them. (Actually the same thing is true even if they are quantifiers. But let us leave that aside for the moment.) In that case, the semantic content of the type “the inventor of bifocals” is some function from contexts (worlds, times) to individuals. In any world where English is spoken, the type “the inventor of bifocals” has the same semantics it has here: its semantic content is that function. Of course, in some of those worlds, somebody other than Benjamin Franklin invented bifocals. We don’t want to say that the type “the inventor of bifocals” can keep the same semantics while having a variable reference. Given any expression that has a referent, its referent – its semantic contribution -- is presumably an integral part of its semantic-content. The semantic content of an expression is what it contributes to the meanings of sentence-tokens in which it occurs. Referring terms contribute their referents. So if a term has a referent, then its referent is, at the very least, a part of its semantic content. If that is right, then it is self-contradictory to say that the very same expression can refer to different things in different worlds and yet have the very same semantics in all those worlds. One can take the heroic measure of saying that the referent of an expression is not a part of its semantic content. But that borders on absurdity. Fortunately, we don’t have to take that measure. We say, simply, the type “the inventor of bifocals” has the same semantics in every world where English is spoken. But in some of those worlds, tokens of...",

So given that you don’t know who the richest man in Holland is, it follows that in so far as you understand (#), what it means to you is some existential generalization: so to the extent that you can understand the definite description without knowing what it refers to, it is a de facto quantifier, not a singular term. The other side of the coin is that, if “the richest man in Holland” is a singular term at the level of literal meaning, then the literal meaning of (#) cannot be (##) or any other existence claim. In fact, if the description is to be a singular term, we must keep the concept richest man in Holland out of the proposition meant by tokens of that sentence; for, as we saw, if we let it there, then such tokens have (##) for their meanings, in which case the definite description is simply a quantifier.

The other side of the coin is that, if we want to maintain that they are singular terms, we must posit an enormous gulf between literal meaning and cognitive content. I myself am going to “bite this bullet”. I think that there is typically a huge gulf between literal meaning and cognitive content. Most of what an utterance conveys to someone does not coincide with that utterance’s literal meaning. One has to compute literal meaning; one has to make one’s way from the sound to the meaning. (You can hear the sound without knowing the meaning.) This involves exploiting semantic and extra-semantic background knowledge. So you learn a lot in...",

Bach” with an expression that does not co-refer with it, then the resulting host expression will not co-refer with (*). What (*) refers to would seem not to be a function of the meanings of the component referring terms. “J.S. Bach” and “the greatest contrapunctalist of all time” have different meanings. So if a sentence refers, then presumably what it refers to is a function of the referents (not the meanings) of its component referring terms. For reasons we’ve considered, this led Frege to hold that sentences refer to truth-values. I too believe that the referent of an expression is always a function of the referents of its components. Like Frege, I grant that truth-value is preserved by inter-substituting co-referring terms. But, unlike Frege, I also believe that the proposition meant by a sentence-token is also thus preserved. The appearance to the contrary, I will argue, embodies a failure to distinguish semantics from pre-semantic implicature, and a failure to distinguish type-semantics from token-semantics. So, in my view, the thesis that sentence-tokens refer to propositions validates compositionality no less than does the thesis that they refer to truth-values. Unlike Frege, I hold that there are no exceptions to the principle of compositionality: the appearance of exceptions, relating to epistemic contexts and the like, embodies the two confusions just mentioned.

What is it for an expression to refer to an object? What is it for “Plato” to refer to Plato? If we want to make a statement about Plato, we can use the expression “Plato”. If we want to express a proposition of the form:…Plato…, we utter a sentence of the form “…Plato…” If we could not use “Plato” to make statements of that form, then “Plato” wouldn’t refer to Plato. It makes no sense to say: “Plato” refers to Plato, but sentences of the form “…Plato…” don’t say anything about Plato. If I want to say that Plato smokes, I will say “Plato smokes”, not “Socrates smokes”. If “Socrates smokes” meant Plato smokes, then (holding constant everything else about the English language), “Plato” would refer to Socrates. Thus, “Plato” refers to Plato exactly if sentences of the form “…Plato…” mean:…Plato… In general, an expression E refers to an object O exactly if tokens of E semantically contribute O the meanings of the sentences in which they occur. (Henceforth, whenever I say that an expression e “semantically contributes” some object o, that is an abbreviated way of saying: tokens of e contribute o to the meanings of sentences in which those tokens occur.) Of course, this has been denied. Frege, Carnap, and Church said that “Plato” and “the teacher of Aristotle” refer to Plato but do not semantically contribute Plato. Instead, these expressions contribute a “sense”: a concept that singles out Plato. But if one says that “Plato” contributes such a concept, then it becomes an expression that either refers to nothing or refers to a second-level function: it becomes a quantifier, not a term that refers to Plato. Russell argued exactly this in the introduction to the Principia Mathematica. A “sense” is a concept. Suppose “the teacher of Aristotle” semantically contributes a concept. Which concept is it? It is the concept: teacher of Aristotle. So “the teacher of Aristotle was wise” encodes a proposition of the form:… teacher of Aristotle…What does that sentence say about that concept? (To simplify exposition, let us ignore irrelevant niceties relating to contextual salience.) If there is no teacher of Aristotle, then that sentence is false.

What is doing so is the expression “the same truth-value as the truth-value that is truth if snow is white and is falsity otherwise”. So (*) is plainly not an example of a case where “snow is white” is functioning at all like “the truth-value true.” If you want to refer to the truth-value true you’ll use an expression like “the truth-value true” or “the property of truth”. But it doesn’t seem possible to use a token of “snow is white” in remotely the same way. Here we would do well to consider a point made by Max Black. Replacing a referring term with a co-referring term will not turn a meaningful utterance into a meaningless one. “The author of the Republic was wise” is meaningful. “The author of the Parmenides” co-refers with “the author of the Republic.” Therefore “The author of the Parmenides was wise” is meaningful. Given this, let us suppose, with Frege, that “snow is white” co-refers with “the True”. Obviously “if three has no factors, then three is prime” is meaningful. If Frege is right, then replacing the antecedent with “the True” ought to be meaningful. But it is not: “if the True, then three is prime” is nonsense. Black’s point works in the other direction.

But when (2) expresses a proposition like (3), “the True” doesn’t function as an expression that refers to the property of truth. It functions rather as a quantifier. (Thus, depending on one’s views on quantifiers, it is functioning either as something that doesn’t refer at all or as something that refers to a second-level function.) The difference between “snow is white” and “the True” isn’t remotely like the difference between “I” and “me”. In the one case, we are dealing with something that is plausibly seen as a mere grammatical difference. In other cases, we are dealing with a much deeper difference: a difference that is reflected in, but not confined to, a grammatical difference. There is a subtler point to make here. Arguably, grammatical differences are semantic differences. There are grammatical differences between “red” and “John”. You can say “John smokes”, but not “red smokes”. (“The property of redness smokes” is false, perhaps even absurd, but perfectly grammatical. But “red smokes” is simply ungrammatical.) But these grammatical differences presumably reflect semantic differences. It could even be maintained (in fact, I will maintain it later) that these semantic differences reduce to differences in what the expressions in question pick out. The idea would be that the one picks out an individual, while the other picks out a function. To take another example: There are profound grammatical differences between “or” and “Smith”. But those differences obviously reflect semantic differences. And a case can be made (I will try to make it) that those semantic differences reduce to differences in what those expressions pick out. (“Or” picks out a higher-order function, “Smith” picks out an individual.) It is by no means clear that grammatical facts can ever be dismissed as merely grammatical – as semantically innocent. On the face of it, they seem to embody semantic facts; and grammatical categories seem to be semantic categories. When you say that “John” and “some man” are “noun phrases”, you are presumably making a statement about the semantic roles of such expressions. By this reasoning, when you say that “I” and “me” are grammatically different, you are saying something about their semantic roles. The temptation is to say that “I” and “me”, and “eager” and “eagerly”, differ merely in ways that are grammatical. But that is, I believe, quite...",

They no more have meaning on their own than does the “ing of goi” in “I’m thinking of going to Indianapolis”. The medievals referred to such expressions as “syncategorematic”. If a term can have meaning but not refer, then meaning and reference pull apart: a term does not necessarily refer to the thing it semantically contributes. This line of thought does not hold up. So-called “syncategorematic” expressions – “and”, “or”, case-markers – are defined contextually. They are defined by showing how they affect the meanings of sentences in which they occur. But it is very easy to turn any contextual definition into a denotative definition. We’ve already seen two examples of this. Russell defines “the phi” contextually: “…the phi…” means: something x uniquely has phi and…x…But that contextual definition is equivalent to a denotative definition: “the phi” denotes a function F that assigns truth to a class C exactly if C comprises exactly one phi and no phi falls outside of C.

It is impossible that a single expression should have both sense and reference. Sense is a property of platonic entities: of expression-types. Reference is a property of spatiotemporal entities: of tokens. According to the “causal theory of reference” (CTR), tokens of “Socrates” refer to Socrates because they bear a certain causal relation to him. The causal theory might seem to conflict with our analysis of reference. I do not believe this is so. There are different kinds of causal relations. The causal theorist has to say which of these is the one that underwrites reference. Let R be an arbitrary causal relation. How does the causal theorist determine if R is reference-constituting or not? If x can stand in relation R to y without y’s semantically contributing x, then it is hard to see how R could be the right relation. The elevator comes because I push the button. But the arrival of the elevator doesn’t refer to the pushing of the button. Why not? Because the arrival of the elevator doesn’t semantically contribute that button-pushing to the meaning of any sentence or any symbol.

For reasons just stated, the meaning of any indexical sentence-type – and, where natural language is concerned, this means any sentence-type – is, at least approximately, a function from contexts to propositions. So the intension of a sentence-type is obviously a function of that kind, not a proposition. Sentence-types don’t have extensions. Only expression-tokens have extensions. Let w* be a world where English is spoken, and where there are more whales than there are here. The extension of “whale” in w* is different from the extension of that expression here. But its semantics is the same. Obviously different tokens of the word “whale” have different extensions. The word “whale” does not itself have an extension. At most, it has different extensions in different contexts (different worlds, different times). But this is just an imprecise way of saying that different tokens of it have different extensions. The type has an intension: a function from contexts (worlds, times) of utterance to classes. Tokens of it have extensions. The extension of a particular token is the thing that the function associated with the corresponding type associates with that token. By parity of reasoning, it is not sentence-types, but sentence-tokens, that have extensions. The extension of a sentence-token is the thing that the function associated with the corresponding type assigns to it. That thing is a proposition, not a truth-value. The sentence-type doesn’t have an extension; it has an intension. Speaking very approximately, that intension is a function from contexts of utterance to propositions. There is another problem with the idea that sentences have truth-values for their extensions or referents. For the sake of argument, let us forget about the distinction between types and tokens. Let us suppose that there are such things as sentences simpliciter. Further, let us suppose, again for the sake of argument, that propositions are the “senses” or “intensions” of such things. The Frege-Carnap idea is this. Given an expression that has both sense (intension) and reference (extension), the referent of that expression is the thing to which the sense applies.

And nothing is more necessary to survival and professional success than occasional deception. But these kinds of success and failure have nothing to do with literal meaning. They have to do with sociology. A semantic theory isn’t supposed to tell us what brings us professional or romantic success. A semantic theory is supposed to tell us only what expressions literally mean. There is exactly one kind of success that a semantics for indicative sentences must be concerned with. Indicative sentence-tokens are supposed to be true. If they are, they are successful. If they are not, they are failures. This is a part of their literal meaning. Nothing having to do with any other kind of success – strategic, monetary, rhetorical – has to do with their literal meanings. Let SG be an utterance of “snow is green”. SG is a failure, because snow is not green.

Only a similarly circular analysis can possibly give the semantic content of a sentence-token. Why is there no vicious circularity? First of all, when I talk about a “sentence-token”, I am talking about a mere physical entity. I am not talking about a pairing of such an entity with some meaning. If I were speaking that way, then any assignment of meanings to “sentence-tokens”, including mine, would be circular. But I just mean a certain physical entity. Consider the physical entity t. To say what t is, we obviously don’t have to mention any function. We can give a complete description of t’s physical properties without mentioning functions involving propositions. For any proposition P, there is some function F that assigns to t the property of success exactly if P is true. After all, given any two entities, there is some function pairing them off. So, for any proposition P, there is no circularity in the statement: there is a function F that assigns success to t exactly if P is true. We are saying that the semantic content of t is one of those functions. As we just saw, for any one of those functions, there is no circularity at all in saying that it is the semantic content of t. Later on, we will deal more fully with the appearance of circularity in our analysis. We will find that a certain circularity is de rigueur.

The force-operator in t – the “A”, along with the brackets – denotes a function that assigns the property of success to t exactly if the proposition just mentioned is true. For reasons discussed earlier, t is semantically successful exactly if the proposition just mentioned is true. So the semantics of t, its semantic content, assign t success exactly if that proposition is true. Therefore, that semantic content is a function assigning success to t exactly if that proposition is true. There are thus two components to t. One component denotes the proposition that Plato snores. That component is identical with the occurrence of “that Plato snores” in t. The other component denotes a certain function. That component is identical with the “A”, along with the brackets, that are in t. The “A” is the assertoric force-operator. The “A” denotes a function that assigns success to t exactly if a certain proposition is true. In general, the assertoric force-operator denotes a function that assigns success to a certain token exactly if a certain proposition is true. The concepts of interrogative force and imperative force are to be analyzed in similar ways. There are many nuances that cannot be dealt with here; I deal with them later on. But a rough statement is not hard to give. We noted that, semantically, indicative sentence-tokens are supposed to be true. Obviously tokens of questions are not supposed to be true, at least not at the level of semantics. Pragmatically, rhetorical questions are true or false. But semantically rhetorical questions are neither true nor false. Semantically a token of “is it so wrong to follow one’s conscience?” is neither true nor false. Like anything else, it can be used to make a true or false statement. But that is irrelevant to semantics. There is more to say. Semantically, a question is not only supposed to be answered: it is supposed to be given a true answer. Everybody who speaks English knows that, at some level, the right response to “does Plato snore” is a statement that affirms a true proposition concerning whether Plato snores. This is part of one’s semantic knowledge. It isn’t pragmatic or sociological knowledge. If someone thinks that a false answer to “does Plato snore?” is just as good as a true answer, then...",

For t to be obeyed is for its addressee, Smith, to make it be the case that the proposition encoded in t is true. So t’s semantic content is a function that assigns it success only if Smith makes it be the case that that Smith marches is true. It also seems that for t to be a success, it is not enough that Smith make that proposition be true: he must also do so in response to t. If he just happens to march, but not in response to t, then strictly speaking t was a failure. (Pragmatically, it may not matter. But we are concerned with semantics only, not with anything else.) Thus, at the level of semantics, t is a success exactly if, in response to that token, the addressee makes it be the case that a certain proposition is true. The semantic content of t is a function that assigns success to t exactly if, in response to t, the addressee, Smith, makes it be the case that the proposition that Smith marches is true. Let us generalize this. Let t be any token of an imperative. Part of what t will encode is some proposition P.

We know from Kripke that such tokens are not disguised descriptions; they are not quantifiers of any kind. Given this, it seems pretty clear that such tokens refer to Plato – Plato is their sole semantic content. I think that this is basically correct. But it can be extended in an interesting direction. Grammarians talk about “noun phrases”. Tokens of “Plato”, “some man”, “most men”, “five girls”, and “Nixon” are noun phrases. Tokens of indexicals are also noun phrases. The same is probably true of tokens of definite descriptions. It is pretty reasonable to assume that quantifiers denote functions. We’ve discussed this. “For some x” denotes a function that assigns truth to a class exactly if that class is instantiated. (More exactly, tokens of “for some x” denote that function. The semantic content of the type is an assignment of that function to its tokens.) Corresponding remarks probably apply to all other quantifiers. Obviously the grammatical properties of tokens of “Plato” are very similar to those of tokens of “some man” and “no man”. I would be very surprised if the class of so-called “noun phrases” was a disjunctive one. The grammatical identity must correspond to some kind of semantic identity. We know from Russell and Frege that logical form cannot be read off of grammatical form. But grammar is not to be ignored. Facts about grammar are like dreams. Dreams always tell us the truth; but they do so obliquely; and we have to learn how to decode them. The same is true of grammar. We don’t want to say that tokens of “some man” and “no man” and “nothing” denote individuals of a strange kind. That would be absurd. Frege and Russell put that beyond dispute. Russell said that “Plato” was really a definite description, and that definite descriptions are in the same category as “some man” and “nothing”. So Russell partially unified the class of noun-phrases: he made a case that all of “Plato”, “no man”, “some man”, and so on, are in the same category: they are all generalized quantifiers. Russell didn’t completely unify the class of noun phrases; for he allowed, rightly, that tokens of demonstratives refer to individuals, and are thus not generalized quantifiers. In any case,...",

This pretense will facilitate exposition. Given what Kripke said, it seems pretty clear that names are mere labels. Given this “Hesperus is Phosphorous” ought to have the same meaning as “Hesperus is Hesperus”. But the two sentences differ in cognitive value, strongly suggesting that they differ in meaning. First of all, there is no point in denying that what is conveyed by “Hesperus is Phosphorous” is radically different from what is conveyed by “Hesperus is Hesperus”. At the same time, I believe that those sentences have the same literal meaning. Our analysis of definite descriptions enables us to deal with this. That analysis need only be supplemented by a few semantic and epistemological platitudes. The first platitude is this. We must distinguish two very different ways in which sentences relate to facts. A sentence can be made true by a fact without being about that fact. The latter relation is much stronger than the former. Suppose you say “Sally met a man”. Suppose you are right. Sally did meet a man: she met Fred. The sentence “Sally met a man” is made true by the fact that Sally met Fred. But “Sally met a man” is not about Fred. You can completely and utterly understand the sentence “Sally met a man”, and have no idea who Fred is. For a sentence to be about some individual is for it to encode a proposition that is about that individual. You can completely understand “Sally met a man” without having any idea who Fred is. So it is hard to see how the proposition encoded in that sentence could be about Fred. Some fact about Fred makes it true. But that sentence is not, strictly speaking, about Fred. (It is about Sally). Let P be the proposition encoded in that sentence. There are no worlds where P is true where Sally does not exist. But there are worlds where P is true where Fred does not exist. Obviously P’s relation to Sally is quite different from its relation to Fred. I think it is fair to mark this difference by saying: P is about Sally, but not about Fred. So...",

    "text": "There is no point in engaging in a terminological dispute. The sense in which “Sally met a man” concerns (or is about) Sally much stronger than the sense in which it concerns Fred (supposing – what I believe false – that it concerns Fred at all). We can use different labels to mark this difference; we might say that “Sally met a man” strongly concerns Sally, but weakly concerns Fred. In that case, a sentence “strongly concerns” x iff x is a constituent of that sentence, and a sentence “weakly concerns” x iff some fact about x makes that sentence true. (Obviously a sentence can both weakly and strongly concern a given individual. Suppose that “Sally loves someone” is made true by the fact that Sally loves herself. In that case, it both weakly and strongly concerns Sally.) To sum up, a sentence can be made true about x without being about x. Put another (less accurate) way, a sentence can be weakly about x without being strongly about x. This is the first of the aforementioned platitudes. Here is the second. What you see, or otherwise perceive, is never just an object; it is a state of affairs comprising an object. The content of any sense-perception is existential, at least in part. You don’t just see Fido; you see an object in a certain place, with a certain shape, and a certain color fur, and so forth. Verbs like “see” and “hear” can have objectual complements. They don’t always have propositional complements. But the relations denoted by these verbs never have merely objectual complements. There is no such thing as a perception that is just a perception of Fido. If people have thought otherwise, it is, perhaps, because they have put too much stock in linguistic facts like the one just mentioned. There is a third platitude. This one is of a more technical nature. Operators can be given varying degrees of scope. Consider the sentence “grass is green and 1+1=2”. We can use the word “necessarily” to construct new sentences out of that sentence: “grass is green and necessarily 1+1=2”, “necessarily (grass is green and 1+1=2)”, “necessarily (grass is green) and 1+1=2”. Some of these are true; some are false. Here the important point is that operators can typically be given varying degrees of scope.

What (a) refers to is a function of the sense of the definite description occurring in it. The same is true of (b). So compositionality requires Frege to hold that in those contexts, definite descriptions refer to their customary senses. For similar reasons, he holds that the same thing applies to proper names. So in oblique contexts referring terms refer to their senses, not their ordinary referents. Frege had another powerful reason for supposing that, in oblique contexts, referring terms refer to their ordinary sense. These reasons relate to Leibniz’s Law. If A=B, then A has a property P iff B has that property. Throughout this work, when I talk about Leibniz’s law, I am not talking about a principle governing the intersubstitutibility of expressions. I am talking about a rule concerning objects. If the object A really is identical with the object B, then surely A cannot have any property not had by B.

If the number one has the property of being such that John believes it to be greater than one, then it has that property. Period. If the number one has that property, then anything identical with it has that property. So that property is also had by the unique number n such that n=2 if there are continuous functions that cannot be differentiated at any point and such that n=1 otherwise is greater than one. But there is no doubt that the proposition communicated by (A) has a different truth-value from that communicated by (B). (And it seems highly reasonable – almost undeniable -- to suppose that this difference has a basis in what is literally meant by those sentences.) Suppose that, in (A) and (B), “two” and “the unique number n such that n=2 if there are continuous functions that cannot be differentiated at any point and such that n=1 otherwise” refer to the number two. In that case, it seems as though both (A) and (B) are doing the same thing. They are attributing a certain property to that number: the property of being a thing x such that John believes x to be greater than one. But if each of (A) and (B) attributes that property to that object, then they cannot differ in truth-value. So since they do differ in truth-value, we must suppose that they don’t have ordinary referents. To sum up, consideration of Leibniz’s Law, in connection with the behavior of expressions in indirect contexts, requires us to suppose that in such contexts expressions refer to their senses, not their ordinary referents. So Frege holds the views previously stated with the qualification that, when an expression occurs in an oblique context, it undergoes a shift in reference: it refers to its sense. Here is what I would like to argue. First, (SS) is wrong; and it is not needed to account for facts about cognitive significance. Second, Frege’s views on indirect reference are wrong.

What is such a constituent is not Franklin, but is rather a “sense”. A sense is a concept (in the non-psychological, platonic sense) – in this case, it would be the concept inventor of bifocals (or perhaps unique inventor of bifocals). So on Frege’s view, the proposition meant by (*) has that concept or sense as a constituent. For the sake of argument, let us suppose, with Frege, that the concept inventor of bifocals is a constituent of the proposition meant by “the inventor of bifocals snored”. In that case, that proposition has the form:…inventor of bifocals…So, presumably, that proposition says something about that concept. Supposing this is the case, what would that proposition say? We know that “the inventor of bifocals snored” is not going to be true if there is no inventor of bifocals. And we know that it won’t be true of there are multiple inventors of bifocals.

So, in Russell’s view, if the concept inventor of bifocals makes it into the proposition meant by “the inventor of bifocals snored”, then that sentence encodes a proposition logically equivalent with: for some x, x uniquely invented bifocals; moreover, x snored. And if that proposition, or one logically equivalent thereto, is what is meant by the sentence in question, then it really does seem that “the inventor of bifocals” is a quantifier (a kind of existential quantifier). To sum up: if the concept inventor if bifocals is a constituent of the proposition meant by sentences of the form “…the inventor of bifocals…”, then it seems that “the inventor of bifocals” is a quantifier, and not a singular term.

If it expressed an identity, then it would be subject to the logical principles governing identities, the main one being Leibniz’s Law. But when we want to derive *the chi has psi* from *the phi=the chi, and the phi has psi*, we have to invoke logical principles appropriate to quantified statements like *something x uniquely has phi, and x also has psi*. So if, as Anderson plausibly maintains, *the phi has psi* is logically equivalent with its Russellian paraphrase, then from a proof-theoretic standpoint, *the phi=the chi* does not (merely) express an identity; from a proof-theoretic standpoint, it seems to express a complicated existence claim; from that standpoint it is much more like its Russellian paraphrase than it is like anything of the form *a=b* (where a and b are proper names). And this again raises the question how *the phi* could be logically equivalent with a Russellian quantifier without actually being one. We have to distinguish identities from identity-statements. Identities either hold necessarily or they don’t hold at all. Nothing can be contingently self-identical, and there is no other kind of identity besides self-identity; so identities hold necessarily (if at all). But the truth expressed by a so-called identity-statement, e.g. “the inventor of bifocals=the first post-master general”, may be contingent. To the extent that a statement expresses a contingent truth, it is not expressing an identity, as we just saw. It is certainly arguable that part of what is expressed by “the inventor of bifocals=the first post-master general” is an identity. But what that sentence says is (on a natural readings of it) contingent, and is therefore not (merely) an identity. It seems that in so far as E1 and E2 really co-refer, then *E1=E2* should express an identity and, therefore, a necessary truth. , I will now try to argue that *E1=E2* can express a contingent truth only to the extent it does not express an identity and, therefore, only to the extent that they are not co-referring terms.

Answer: the sense of “the inventor of bifocals” – the concept (unique) inventor of bifocals. Clearly (&) is doing much more than ascribing the property of being identical with Franklin to Franklin. (Actually, it isn’t clear to me that even part of what (&) does is ascribe self-identity to Franklin.) The definite description has what Strawson described as a “predicational” function: the property of being a unique inventor of bifocals is predicated of Franklin. Perhaps we can see the definite description as a singular term that refers to Franklin. But plainly it is also functioning as a device of predication. What makes (&) non-trivial is precisely that it conveys the message that Franklin invented bifocals. So (&) is non-trivial because the definite description picks out, or is part of an expression that picks out, a property. In so far as the definite description is a device of predication, it seems natural to see it as picking out a property, and not (merely) a person. It is a little hard to see how *x=the inventor of bifocals* could ascribe the property of being a unique bifocal inventor to x unless the “=the inventor of bifocals” picked out that property; and it’s a little hard to see how that expression could pick out that property if the definite description did not, in its turn, pick out at least some of the properties constitutive of that property. So I am not completely out on a limb when I say that, in functioning predicatively, the definite description in (&) can be seen as (inter alia) picking out a property (or multiple properties). This is not to deny that it does pick out a person. But it apparently also has a predicative function, and thus picks out a property. So the extent that definite descriptions function predicatively, they do not merely refer to individuals. That is probably part of what they do; but they also, so it appears, pick out properties.

So even though they both refer to Franklin, neither just refers to Franklin, and on the whole they do not co-refer: they overlap in reference. So the steps in the Slingshot that depend on the idea that they (and other such pairs) “co-refer” involve, I believe, a muddle. Saying that those expressions co-refer is like saying that “Bill and Ted” and “Bill and Steve” co-refer. So far as I can tell, the only way to block this conclusion is to say that “the inventor of bifocals” can function predicatively without referring to any property. In defense of such a position, it might be said that it “expresses” or perhaps “connotes” a property without actually referring to it. But this move puts a lot of weight on what, arguably, is a mere matter of nomenclature. When you say that “the inventor of bifocals” expresses or connotes the property of being a unique bifocal inventor, what you are saying is that *the inventor of bifocals has phi* says, or at least implies, that somebody or other uniquely invented bifocals, and that any such person has phi.

So any such sentence does not presuppose the existence of a king of France, but actually affirms it. So Frege is guilty of inconsistency. This criticism is not an ad hominem attack on Frege’s particular system; it has more general consequences for semantics. If FFA is right, then *the phi* asserts the existence of a unique phi. But in that case, *the phi has psi* is simply false if there is no (unique) phi, meaning that *the phi has psi* does not presuppose existence of a phi. In that case, *the phi* does not refer at all: where there is reference, there is a presupposition of existence, not an affirmation of it. If you say “that man [pointing to Fred] is a scoundrel”, you are not affirming the existence of a contextually salient man; you are presupposing it.

Smith would, I think, be able to understand (&), but not (&&). So the semantic or linguistic competence needed to understand – to grasp the meaning of -- (&) is not sufficient for a grasp of (&&). Somebody who understands (&) needs to call on extra-semantic logical acumen to see that it entails (%); linguistic competence is not enough. Let me put this another way. “Socrates snored” is true exactly if Socrates snored. This is a matter of semantics: in virtue of having the right bit of linguistic or semantic competence, one knows that “Socrates snored” is true iff Socrates snored. For obvious reasons, “Socrates snored” is true exactly if somebody x is uniquely identical with Socrates, and x snored. But this is a matter of logic, not (merely) of semantics. The semantic rule for “Socrates snores” is simply: “Socrates snored” means Socrates snored (or is true iff Socrates snored). The semantic rule doesn’t involve any mention of quantifiers or identity. So the bit of semantic competence that is needed to understand “Socrates snored” is not, by itself, sufficient for knowing that “Socrates snored” is true iff something x is uniquely identical with Socrates, and x snored.

It is irrelevant if Smith snores or if Jones doesn’t snore. All of this is obviously bound up with the fact that “Franklin” refers to Franklin. If “Franklin snores” were made true by Smith’s snoring, then (holding constant the other semantic rules of English), “Franklin” would refer to Smith.

To say that “the inventor of bifocals” “non-rigidly” refers to Franklin is an entirely different thing from saying that it is logically equivalent with its Russellian counterpart. In other words, given only that “the inventor of bifocals” non-rigidly refers to Franklin, it could still be the case that “the inventor of bifocals snores” encodes the proposition: Franklin snores. Let me clarify. Demonstratives are paradigm cases of non-rigid designators. “You” refers to different people on different occasions of use. There is no one thing x such that any given token of *you are phi* means that x has phi. But for any given token of *you have phi*, there is some x such that that token means x has phi. Let us consider a case that is a little closer to home. Let us invent an article “the#” to be defined as follows. Let w be an arbitrary world, and suppose that, in w, O is the unique thing having phi. In that case, a token of *the# phi has psi* in w encodes the proposition: O has psi. So *the# phi* is a demonstrative: it picks out the thing which, in the world of utterance, has phi; and *the# phi has psi* encodes a singular proposition to the effect that that thing has psi (just as a token of *you have psi*, addressed to Fred, encodes a singular proposition to the effect that Fred has psi). So “the# inventor of bifocals snores” encodes the proposition: Franklin snored. (This is what Strawson said about “the”.) Obviously “the# inventor of bifocals” is not a rigid designator. In w2, it refers to Jefferson. In w3, it refers to Hartry Field. But, in any world w, a token of “the# inventor of bifocals snored” means O snored (where O is the unique inventor of bifocals). So even if an expression E non-rigidly refers to Franklin, it may still be the case that *E snored* means: Franklin snored. So the semantic differences between “Franklin” and “the inventor of bifocals” – that fact that “Franklin snored” means Franklin snored, whereas “the inventor of bifocals snored” means something that can be true in worlds where Franklin doesn’t exist or does exist but doesn’t snore -- cannot be dealt with merely by saying that “Franklin” rigidly denotes Franklin, whereas “the inventor of bifocals” non-rigidly him.",

    "text": "§ Now let us apply the points just made to the Slingshot. Suppose that when “the inventor of bifocals” occurs in a sentence (or sentence-token, to be precise), the resulting proposition has the sense of that expression as a constituent. In other words, suppose that FFA is right. In that case, “the inventor of bifocals snored” means something x uniquely invented bifocals, and x snored. So if FFA is right, then “the inventor of bifocals” ends up being a quantifier, and Russell’s theory of descriptions is right. We know that if the theory of descriptions is right, then every form of the Slingshot is blocked. So each form of the Slingshot requires that FFA be wrong: when *the phi* occurs in a sentence, what makes it into the proposition is not the sense of that expression, but only the thing (if any) referred to. So if O is the unique phi, then the proposition meant by *the phi snores* is simply O snores. And (supposing that O also uniquely has property chi) the proposition meant by *the phi is identical with the chi*, is simply O=O. This can be encapsulated in the slogan: if definite descriptions are singular terms, they are directly referential. (The sense of a definite description would still have an important semantic role: but that role would simply be to pick out the thing which makes it into the proposition in question, and that sense would not itself make it in there. Even relegated to that role, that sense will still do the relevant cognitive work; it will still suffice to make “the inventor of bifocals snored” and “the first post-master general snored” convey radically different propositions. This is because, as we will see, much of what is communicated by an utterance is pre-semantic.) Given this, let us look at some famous Slingshots.",

But many people believe, or used to believe, that modal operators, like “necessarily” and “possibly”, are meaningless or result in systematic falsity. This position is associated with hard-line Humean empiricism. Russell held that “necessarily” and “possibly” are meaningless or superfluous. He said, first, that necessity and possibility are not properties of propositions, but of propositional functions. And he said that for a propositional function to be “necessarily” true is simply for it to be true for all values of its variables. Of course, he couldn’t say that a propositional function is “necessary” if it is true for all possible values of its variables; that would make his analysis circular, since “possible” and “necessary” are interdefinable. So Russell took the counter-intuitive position of saying that for a propositional function to be necessary is for it to be true for all actual values of its variables. So, for Russell, what is expressed by “for any time t, Plato did not smoke a cigarette at t” is necessary, since it is true for all actual values of its variables. But this analysis of necessity doesn’t correspond even remotely to our modal judgments. A true proposition is vacuously true for all values of its free-variables. So Russell has said, in effect, that any two true propositions are necessary, and any two false ones are impossible. Plainly, Russell has not analyzed the concept of necessity; he has banished it from discourse. Quine used the Slingshot to reinforce this kind of antipathy towards modality. Quine had a special reason for wanting to show that modal notions were corrupt. In “Two Dogmas of Empiricism”, he argued that there are no analytic sentences. In effect, he argued that there are no necessary propositions. Quine didn’t distinguish epistemic from metaphysical necessity; he thought that, if there was any necessity at all, it was the kind characteristic of “1+1=2”; he didn’t recognize the kind (supposedly) characteristic of “water is H2O”. So Quine needed there to be no epistemically necessary propositions; for this thesis was a cornerstone of his views on language and scientific explanation. He thought, presumably, that his Slingshot provided independent corroboration for this thesis. It is worth showing why Quine’s Slingshot fails.

Obviously Smith is bald is not metaphysically necessary. So we must say that “Necessarily” induces opacity. Thus, “1+1=2” means one thing on its own, and a completely different thing in “necessarily 1+1=2”, and yet a different thing in “it is necessarily the case that necessarily 1+1=2”.

Let “necessarily*” have the same meaning as “necessarily”, except that, by our stipulation, any sentence S falling within the scope of “necessarily*” bears the proposition that it customarily (in truth-functional contexts) bears. If I say “necessarily* 1+1=2” I am saying, of the proposition customarily borne by “1+1=2”, that it is necessary. Surely there is some proposition to exactly that effect. An analogue of TF shows that either Bob is bald is necessary* or that “necessarily*” induces opacity. We know the latter is false. And we know, on independent grounds, that the former is false.

It will turn out that both (m) and (d) are false regardless of how we treat definite descriptions. First, suppose that definite descriptions are quantifiers. In that case, “the unique thing x such that x=Socrates, and x is bald” means: something is uniquely identical with Socrates, and x is bald. This proposition is not identical with the proposition Socrates is bald. They are logically equivalent – but not identical. The one proposition is an existence-claim; the other is not. The one proposition has the concepts of identity and uniqueness as constituents; the other does not. Those propositions have different compositions. Also, logical equivalence here would have to be proved. It would be an easy proof. But that doesn’t matter. Where equivalence has to be proved, then (it seems to me) we are dealing with distinct propositions. So if definite descriptions are treated as quantifiers, then “the unique thing x such that x=Socrates, and x is bald” and “Socrates is bald” do not mean the same thing, and (m) is false. Let us deal with (d). Once again, suppose that definite descriptions are treated as quantifiers. In that case, as we just saw, “the unique thing x such that x=Socrates, and x is bald” and “Socrates is bald” encode different propositions. In that case, (d) is false if sentences denote propositions. So for (d) to be true, it must be assumed that sentences do not denote propositions. But this cannot be assumed in this context. In the context of an argument purporting to establish what sentences denote, it cannot be assumed that they don’t denote propositions. To sum up, if definite descriptions are treated as quantifiers, then (m) becomes false and (d) becomes question-begging; so G3 becomes either false or question-begging, depending on whether we take “signification” to mean denotation or meaning. So if G3 is to be true, then definite descriptions must be treated as singular terms. So for the sake of argument, let us suppose that they are in fact singular terms. In that case, G4 becomes false.

There were independent motivations (not to say justifications) for these views. Empiricists have always held meaning (propositionality) and modality in contempt. (Interestingly, these notions are interconnected.) And the notion of a fact is famously problematic. Under what circumstances are x and y different facts? Let H be some heart. Consider some instance of H’s beating. That beating involves innumerable sub-atomic events. Let E1…En be those events. Is the occurrence of E1…En identical with the beating of that heart? Is the fact that triangles have three sides identical with the fact that a thing has three sides iff it a closed, straight-edged figure such that any two, but not all three, of its sides intersect? Do facts decompose in the same way as the propositions that express them? Consider the proposition H is beating at time t. That proposition has a fairly simple decomposition. But the event of H’s beating is obviously far less simple. That suggests that propositions and facts are altogether different sorts of things. But how are we to individuate facts except in terms of the propositions that affirm them? These questions are not easy to answer. Some say that there is no principled way of answering them and that, consequently, the concept of a “fact” is an incoherent one. So we should do away with facts. The Slingshot, evidently, gives this antipathy a logical, as opposed to purely emotional, basis. There is another dimension to this. A number of philosophers and psychologists think that the notion of a representation is bankrupt. The later Wittgenstein is one of the more vigorous spokespersons for this viewpoint. Davidson added a new wrinkle to this debate. He argues that the notion of a representation is closely bound up with the notion of a fact. In his view, if there are no facts, or only one fact, then there are no representations. If the fact that snow is white collapses into the fact that grass is green, then the corresponding representations also collapse, which would make representations useless.

This is what the Slingshot proves. Here is a similar argument. Some philosophers distinguish between constitution and identity. The statue is not identical with the clay because you can destroy the statue without destroying the clay. But the clay obviously constitutes the statue. Everyone agrees that every physical entity is either identical with, or constituted by, displacements of mass-energy. Your car is constituted by a long, complicated series of mass-energy displacements. Let S be a sentence that describes exactly that series. Your favorite shirt is constituted by some entirely distinct series of mass-energy displacements. Let S* be a sentence that describes exactly that series.

Obviously, the Slingshot proves too much. There must be something wrong with it. We’ve seen one thing that is wrong with it – it presupposes an incoherent conception of reference. But other things are wrong with it. In fact, it can be shown that if we accept the conception of reference that the Slingshot needs, that actually makes the Slingshot fail. The Slingshot fails on its own terms. Most Slingshots involve (LL) and (CR). There are a number of problems here. (CR) is, I believe, correct. In fact, I think it holds without restriction. The problem is that the semantics that is needed to make (CR) be true also undermines the Slingshot. As we will see, the semantics that the Slingshot needs require that (CR) be true only in certain contexts. So, somewhat ironically, the Slingshot needs (CR) to be less than strictly true; it needs a certain weakening of (CR) to be true. But we will see, first, that the Slingshot cannot non-question-beggingly use any version of (CR) and, second, that there is no principled weakening. (CR) is like butterfly wings: if you touch it, it is destroyed. When we try to abridge (CR), it becomes worthless, and it drags down any semantic superstructure that it is meant to support. I will argue this in a moment. The other problem concerns (LL). There are several problems here. First, (LL) cannot be non-question-beggingly used in the needed contexts. Second, any arguments that might be given for (LL) turn out to be fallacious; and the intuitive motivations for it dissolve. When we attend to some key innovations of contemporary semantics, e.g. the distinction between type-semantics and also token-semantics and also that between sentence-logic and proposition-logic. (Any token of the sentence “I exist” must be true; so, from one viewpoint, any such sentence-token is “logically equivalent” with a token of “1+1=2”.

So it is natural to identify a sentence’s referent with its truth-value. When one is trying to prove that sentences refer to truth-values, one is also, at least by implication, trying to prove two other things. First, sentences do refer to something or other. Second, they don’t refer to propositions. What does “snow is white” refer to? One possible (not to say correct) answer is: the proposition that snow is white. Later I hope to show that there is some demonstrative support for this view. If you say “if snow is white, then snow is not green”, you are asserting that a certain relation – a relation of consequence -- holds between two propositions (that snow is white and that snow is not green). It is thus natural to see the “if” (or “if…then…”) as something like a two-place predicate that ascribes the consequence-relation to pairs of propositions, and to see sentences falling within the scope of “if” as denoting those propositions. In any case, someone who is putting forth an argument that sentences refer to truth-values certainly cannot take it for granted that they don’t refer to propositions. Such an argument would be question-begging. Now there are perhaps good grounds for thinking that sentences don’t refer to propositions. But those grounds would have to be provided independently.

If sentences do rigidly denote propositions, then replacing a referring term in a sentence S with a co-referring term can result in a sentence S* that does not co-refer with S. If “the inventor of bifocals snores” rigidly refers to the proposition it means, then replacing the definite description in that sentence with “the first post-master general” will result in a sentence that does not co-refer with the original sentence. So if sentences rigidly denote propositions, then (CR) is useless for the proponent of the Slingshot. So such a person must assume that sentences do not rigidly denote propositions. But this is not something that can be assumed in this context. Further, as we discussed earlier, there is good reason to think that it does denote that proposition. Consider the sentence “if Mozart wrote music, then somebody wrote music ”. What is going on here? This sentence affirms a relation between two positions (that Mozart wrote music and that somebody wrote music). It says that the one entails the other.

Let me outline the argument I’m about to give. As we’ve noted, the Slingshot needs it to be possible to change meaning by inter-substituting co-referring terms. In other words, the Slingshot needs (SS). At the same time, if (SS) is granted, then it immediately follows that some contexts are not extensional, and this invalidates some of the steps in the Slingshot. For the sake of argument, let’s suppose that there are non-extensional contexts. There are a few different ways of defining the term “non-extensional.” But on any of those definitions, (CR) is voided, and all that is left is the innocuous triviality that intersubstituting co-referring terms preserves reference except when it changes reference. This is not acceptable. (CR) must be correct; for (CR) is equivalent to the principle of compositionality, and compositionality is surely correct. Bottom line: if we grant that there are non-extensional contexts, then we must throw out CR and, therefore, the principle of compositionality. Since (CR) is correct, it follows that there are no extensional contexts. And if there are no extensional contexts, then it follows that (SS) is false. So (SS) entails that compositionality is false, and is therefore itself false. We will find that the data which motivate the view that there are such contexts can easily be accommodated within a purely extensionalist semantics: the trick is to look very carefully at what is done pre-semantically.

The proposition communicated by (a) is simply: John believes that four is greater than three. Everybody agrees that what is communicated by tokens of (a) will differ, and can therefore differ in truth-value, from what is communicated by tokens of (b). The question is: is this difference in respect of what is communicated a matter of literal meaning? Is the literal meaning of (a) different from that of (b)? Somebody who believes that there are intensional contexts says “yes”. Let us refer to that doctrine as “intensionalism”. My own answer to that question is this. First, we must distinguish types from tokens. The semantics of the type associated with (a) is very different from the semantics of the type associated with (b). But I believe that tokens of (a) have the same literal meanings as tokens of (b). I believe that the massive differences in respect of what is communicated derive, not from semantics, but from pre-semantics. But right now we are not going to deal with that issue: we are going to confine ourselves to demonstrating one thing: (SS) entails that compositionality is false, and is therefore itself false. For the sake of argument, let us assume that intensionalism is correct. In this context, we are going to have to ignore the distinction between types and tokens.

For this reason, “Smith” refers to Smith; indeed, for this reason, “Smith” refers to Smith in the strongest possible sense. If “grass is green” occurs as a part of a sentence S, then the proposition that grass is green is ipso facto a component of the proposition meant by S. So the relation between such an occurrence of “grass is green” and the proposition that grass is green is identical with the relation between “Smith” and Smith.

In any case, a very counter-intuitive analysis of reference would have to be produced to validate (*). So far as I can tell, (*) is the only live alternative to our analysis of extensionality.

In (a), the occurrence of “four is greater than three” has all the symptoms Taylor mentions. In (e), the corresponding occurrence has none of those symptoms. Since the occurrence in the one is doing precisely the same thing as the corresponding occurrence in the other, we cannot say the presence of these symptoms in (a) has anything to do with some kind of semantic shift. The presence of those symptoms must derive from the material surrounding that occurrence. The occurrence itself is disease-free. Now we are in a position to see why intensionalism is inconsistent with the principle of compositionality. As we just saw, there is no denying that the occurrence of “four is greater than three” in (a) is semantically just like its counterpart in (e). The intensionalist must admit this. If this intensionalist is right, then in (e), we must not say that the occurrences of “four” and “three” are referring to numbers. If the intensionalist is right, then replacing the occurrence of “four” in (e) with “the number of stomachs had by the average cow” results in a false sentence. So if the intensionalist is right, then for reasons discussed earlier, it would be inconsistent with Leibniz’s Law to hold that, in (e) those occurrences refer to numbers.

The only answer to be given is this: “In (a) and (e), those occurrences occur within the an expression that denotes a proposition, whereas this is not the case with the corresponding occurrences in (h).” But this answer is false, as we’ve seen. An intensionalist must insist that the occurrences of “four” and “three” do not refer to the same things as their counterparts in (a) and (e): and on the basis of this very fact, he might deny that the component sentences in (h) refer to propositions. But this is obviously just an epicycle. We know that the component sentences in (h) pick out propositions. This is a hard datum. Nobody would deny it (though some would deny that this is enough for bona fide reference). According to the intensionalist, the occurrences of “four” in (a) and (e) don’t refer to a number. This is not a datum: it is a requirement of a theory. Further, that requirement is itself opposed to some sturdy pre-theoretic intuitions: it is itself an epicycle. So the intensionalist is denying hard data to keep a theory afloat: he is adding epicycle to epicycle. This is a classic symptom of what Imre Lakatos referred to as “degenerating research program”.

Or we can prefix it with an “it is true”. Suppose we drop the “that”. We then end up with (g). From a purely orthographic standpoint, (g) is simpler than (i). But semantically (g) is more complex. (i) simply picks out a proposition; it doesn’t do anything with it. But (g) not only indicates a proposition: it affirms it. So (g) involves picking out that proposition and affirming it.

Consider a language English* that is just like English except for one thing: in English*, phonetic surface structure never hides semantic structure the way it hides it in English. The English*-translation of (i) would comprise an occurrence of something that indicated the proposition that four is greater than three. It would comprise an occurrence of an expression like “that four is greater than three”. What I am suggesting is that the non-occurrence of “that four is greater than three” in (g) is an orthographic epiphenomenon – it is a simple case of ellipsis.

What you are saying is elliptical for “Bob ate your cookie”. Here is a less trivial example. Depth-grammarians have made a powerful case that in “John wants to go to the store”, the occurrence of “to go to the store” is really elliptical for “that John go to the store”. So semantically, though not phonetically, there are two occurrences of “John” in that sentence. For similar reasons, I believe that, in (g), there is an aphonic occurrence of “that four is greater than three”.

That occurrence passes all the tests passed by its counterpart in “four is greater than three” and failed by its counterpart in (a). So the intensionalist says that a context can be intensional even though it doesn’t bear any resemblance at all to our paradigms of intensionality. So a context can be intensional even if it has none of the properties definitive of our concept of intensionality. This, it seems to me, borders on incoherence. § There is one other point to consider. We can’t define an intensional context as one where (CR) doesn’t hold, i.e. as one that doesn’t tolerate intersubstitutions of co-referring terms. That would trivialize the principle of compositionality, as I would now like to argue. The principle of compositionality is equivalent with (CR). So if we defined an intensional context in the way proposed, then we’d have to say this: compositionality holds except in intensional contexts, and an intensional context is one where compositionality doesn’t hold. In other words, compositionality holds – except when it doesn’t. And (CR) holds – except when it doesn’t. So compositionality/CR would be nullified if we defined an intensional context as one where (CR) doesn’t hold. We must therefore regard the exceptions to (CR) as symptoms of an underlying conditional. What is that condition? The only viable answer is: (CR) fails to hold when the context in question (rigidly) denotes a meaning (a proposition or concept) of some kind.

The Slingshot thus requires that there be non-extensional contexts: for if (CR) holds without fail, then (SS) becomes false; and if (SS) is false, the Slingshot is immediately voided. The problem is this. Suppose we grant that there are intensional contexts. We cannot define an “intensional” context as one where (CR) doesn’t hold; because then (CR) becomes trivial: intersubstitutions of co-referring terms preserves reference – except when it doesn’t. And we can’t define an “intensional” context as one where a proposition is rigidly denoted: for that would falsely make all contexts intensional, given a plausible conception of reference. So if we grant the semantics which the Slingshot needs, then (CR) is stripped of any content, and is therefore useless to the Slingshot. More importantly, any semantics which strips (CR) of content must be rejected. So there is no tenable semantics that will validate the Slingshot. § Now it is time to apply the points we’ve been developing to the Slingshot. We’ve seen that, if (SS) is false, then the Slingshot immediately fails. (We’ve also seen some reason to be believe that (SS) is false.) In this section, we will suppose, for the sake of argument, that (SS) is true. And we will see that even if this is granted, the Slingshot fails. So we will see that the Slingshot fails on its own terms – it fails even relative to its own semantics.",

    "text": "So far we’ve made a prima facie case that the Slingshot cannot use (LL). But perhaps there is still hope. Suppose that (LL) could be independently motivated – suppose it could be shown that (LL) was true. In that case, perhaps, it could be used in the context of a Slingshot argument. In this chapter, I wish to show that the exact opposite is the case. There are no demonstrative grounds for (LL). And, when we register a couple of key insights of contemporary semantics, there turn out to be no intuitive grounds for it. So far as I can tell, there are a few different reasons – but none of them is compelling. One is the idea – prevalent in the days of logical positivism, but now generally rejected -- that logically equivalent sentences “say the same thing” and are thus synonymous; and, being synonymous, they must co-refer (in any case, they cannot differ in reference). One problem with this argument is that logically equivalent sentences sometimes don’t say the same thing – “triangles have three sides”, “1+1=2”. Another is that, even if it were granted that they always do say the same thing, it isn’t clear why they would have to refer to anything. There is, I believe, another reason that LL is sometimes accepted. In his version of the Slingshot, Davidson uses the principle that logically equivalent singular terms necessarily co-refer. From this it follows that sentences (if singular terms) must have the same referent if they are logically equivalent. Consider the expressions: “the unique x such that x=Plato and 1+1=2” and “the unique x such that x=Socrates if 1+1=3 and x=Plato if 1+1=2”. Being logically equivalent, they must co-refer. So, up to this point, Davidson’s principle seems pretty reasonable. When we apply it to logically equivalent sentences, it is natural to conclude that they too must co-refer. Most versions of the Slingshot do not overtly use the assumption that logically equivalent singular terms co-refer – they use the assumption that logically equivalent sentences co-refer. But I think that part of the motivation for LL is precisely the belief that logically equivalent singular terms must co-refer; LL is thought to be an innocuous extension of that principle. If this is indeed the reasoning behind LL, then LL is founded on poor reasoning. When you say that “triangles have three sides” and “1+1=2” are “logically equivalent”, you are...",

    "text": "When one says that those two definite descriptions are “logically equivalent”, one is saying that, as a matter of logic, if a thing satisfies the condition necessary to be referred to by the one description, then it must also satisfy the condition necessary to be referred to by the other description. Now when you say that “1+1=2” and “triangles have three sides” are logically equivalent, you are not saying anything about the conditions that things must satisfy to be referred to by those expressions; one isn’t saying anything about reference. So one is guilty of an equivocation in saying that logically equivalent sentences must co-refer on the grounds that “logically equivalent” definite descriptions must co-refer: two different senses of logical equivalence are at work. Now there is a way to deal with this – and this brings us to what I believe is the third possible motivation for LL. Definite descriptions (plausibly) have both sense and reference. The sense, presumably, is something like a concept – something like a condition that things may or may not satisfy. The sense of “the king of France” is the concept unique king of France, which is not so different from the propositional-function: x is a unique king of France. The referent is the thing that satisfies that open-proposition. So the sense is (in effect) a propositional-function (x is a unique king of France), and the referent is the thing which satisfies that function. The sense is a concept of the referent. Given this, one could make the following reasonable claim: the sense of a whole sentence is a proposition; a proposition can be seen as a kind of propositional function – perhaps as a limiting case of such a thing. The referent of a sentence is the thing which satisfies that function. Then one would close the argument by saying: the thing which satisfies such a function is always a truth-value. So propositions are concepts of truth-values. Kaplan once wrote:",

    "text": "[T]he question of the truth value of which a given proposition actually is a concept and the individual of which a given individual concept actually is a concept are…empirical. That is, although a given proposition may actually be a concept of Truth, there are usually other possible states with respect to which it is a concept of Falsehood. In addition to being concepts of truth-values, propositions are the senses of sentences. So, to conclude this argument, sentences refer to truth-values, just as “the inventor of bifocals” refers to Franklin. But there is a problem here. If a proposition is a kind of function, then it is a function of zero-argument places. So every true proposition is vacuously satisfied by everything, and every false one by nothing. Thus if we accept that propositions are the senses of sentences, then the referent of a proposition is either everything or nothing, depending on whether it is true or false. But in that case, logically equivalent false sentences don’t co-refer (things that don’t refer at all cannot co-refer). Second, the moment we accept the idea that propositions are concepts, we are bound to accept that materially equivalent propositions are concepts of everything – not just truth-values, but water and peanut-butter and propositions and everything else. So it then becomes a little unclear how one could use the principle that logically equivalent sentences co-refer within the context of an argument purporting to show that sentences refer (exclusively) to truth-values. There is, perhaps, another way to conceive of propositions; and it might be thought that LL is validated by this other conception. We are generally told that some propositions have different truth-values in different possible worlds. So Socrates was wise is true in w1 and false in w2, and so forth. At the same time, we want to say that there is such a thing as the proposition Socrates was wise. So that proposition is assigned truth in w1 and falsity in w2, and so forth. It thus pairs off worlds with truth-values – it is, in effect, a function from worlds to truth-values. If that is right, then propositions are concepts of worlds (or sets of worlds), and not truth-values. Consider the function x is bald. We can see this as pairing off individuals with truth-values. Since Socrates is bald, that function pairs off Socrates with the truth-value true. Since John Kerry is not bald,...",

    "text": "§ There is another, more interesting problem with (LL). Two pieces of background information must first be given. The first is the distinction between sentence-types and sentence-tokens. For reasons we considered earlier, it is sentence-tokens that encode propositions. The content of a sentence-type is a function that assigns propositions to its tokens on the basis of context. This is obviously the case with sentences that contain indexicals. The type “I am tired now” doesn’t encode a proposition. The content of the type is a function that assigns propositions to its tokens on the basis of facts about the context of utterance – who is doing the speaking, and when the utterance occurs. So some kind of “two-dimensionalism” is needed – the meaning of a sentence-token is one thing, and the meaning of a sentence-type is another. It might be thought that two-dimensionalism is needed only for a special sub-class of sentences. Sentence-types seem not to have a context-sensitive component. Perhaps where they are concerned, token-meaning and type-meaning coincide. I think this is a mistake. First of all, every sentence of natural language comprises a tense-marker. Tense-markers seem to be indexicals that refer to times. And even if, technically, they aren’t indexicals, their presence always creates a gulf between type- and token-meaning, and thus warrants a two-dimensionalism. So they are like indexicals in the respect that is relevant in this context. Consider the sentence-type: “Bob is in the kitchen”. A token of that type that occurs at t is true, and a token that occurs at t* is false. That isn’t because one and the same proposition is both true and false: we don’t need to accept the existence of true-contradictions. What is going on is much more innocent. The one proposition is true iff Bob is in the kitchen at t, and the other is true iff Bob is in the kitchen at t*. Obviously that truth-conditional difference derives form the presence of the case-marker. (The tense-marker is not phonetically realized in all languages. But it is still doing its job.) So tokens of that type encode different propositions. So, in that case, the presence of case-markers warrants a two-dimensionalist approach. Independently of this, considerations of uniformity warrant our applying two-dimensionalism to all sentences, even those that appear resolutely context-insensitive. (Sentences of formal languages, or formal extensions of natural language, seem context-insensitive. Consider the type “1+1=2”.) It is very hard...",

It is also clear how the position just described elegantly reconciles the plausible view that “the current U.S. president” is a singular term with the fact that the proposition that is communicated by a token of “the U.S. president snores” is very different from that communicated by a token of “Bush snores”. Presumably English speakers know the rules which assign meaning to the expressions of their own language. (In any case, they know the basic ones, and at least some of the derivative ones. Otherwise it would be impossible to explain how anyone ever understood what anyone else was saying.) At some level, in some way, English speakers surely know that “snow” means snow and “snow is white” means snow is white. And surely this point generalizes to other utterances. Given this, suppose for the sake of argument that (iv) gives the right semantic rule. Any English speaker hearing a token of “the current U.S. president snores” will know that, if it is to be true, there must be exactly one U.S. President O, and also that O snores. So an utterance of that sentence will inevitably convey the proposition: there is exactly one U.S. President O, and O snores. There is a difference between hearing the noise “the current U.S. president snores”, on the one hand, and knowing what it means. A person who doesn’t speak English hears the noise but doesn’t know the meaning. The gulf between hearing the noise and knowing the meaning is bridged by some kind of background knowledge; this includes (but is not limited to) knowledge of the right semantic rules. Supose that (iv) is the right rule. In that case, one assigns the right meaning to the noise via one’s knowledge that if there is a unique President O at the time of utterance, then that noise is true exactly if O snores. So to any competent speaker, that utterance will be associated with a certain existence-claim. But that association is pre-semantic. The semantics of that noise is the proposition Bush snores.

    "text": "When a person hears a token of “Bush snores”, the pre-semantic work he does to assign it the right meaning don’t say anything about the number or existence of U.S. Presidents. So what is pre-semantically implicated by a token of “Bush snores” will not remotely like what is thus communicated by a token of “the U.S. President snores”. An exactly similar story explains why tokens of “that man over there is tired” and “Bob is tired” and “you are tired” will tend to communicate very different propositions, even if one and the same person is referred to in all three cases. To sum up, there is nothing strange about Strawson’s contention that sentence-logic may diverge from proposition-logic. On the contrary, granted the assumption that speakers of a language have some minimal awareness of the semantic rules characteristic of that language, Strawson’s contention reconciles our intuition that definite descriptions are singular terms with the facts about the cognitive significance of expressions containing definite descriptions. But right now, we are not worried about the correct semantics of definite descriptions, or about the nature of reference. We are going to focus on the facts about logical equivalence brought to light by Strawson’s groundbreaking work – his distinction between type- and token-semantics (he uses the term “utterances”, instead of “tokens”), and his distinction between expression-logic and proposition-logic. Let T and T* be two logically equivalent sentences-tokens, encoding propositions P and P*. Suppose that P and P* are not logically equivalent. (So T and T* might be contemporaneous tokens of “I am here now”, uttered by Fred in Paris in 2005, and “Fred is in Paris in 2005” uttered by someone else.) Advocates of (LL) presumably don’t have this sort of situation in mind. Even if -- along with Stalnaker, Lewis, and the logical positivists – we identify logically equivalent propositions, we cannot do that with the propositions involved here. Also, there are no intuitive or demonstrative grounds for saying that P and P* are concepts of the same thing. A proposition is a description, and therefore a way of presenting, the world. So, as we discussed earlier, it certainly seems that a proposition is a concept of a world. P is true in some worlds where P* is not true, and vice versa. So P and P* are concepts of different worlds and thus are not concepts of the same thing. The advocate of...",

What I am calling sentence-logic corresponds very closely to Fregean sense. As a result, once we grant the mere existence of a distinction expression-logic and proposition-logic, it becomes impossible not to grant that sentence-tokens refer to the propositions they encode. Let T be a token of “I am here now”, uttered by Fred at time t in place p. Let T* be a token of “Fred is in place p and time t.” Given what Kaplan (1989) says, we have good reason to believe that T and T* both have the same proposition for their literal meaning (Fred is in place p and time t). But there is no doubt that T and T* communicate very different propositions. So – whatever their literal meanings might be – there is no doubt that they have dramatically different cognitive values. What would a Fregean say here? He would say T and T* have different senses. In any case, if Frege’s sense-reference semantics applies anywhere, it applies here. What is communicated by T is trivial; what is communicated by T* is non-trivial. The sense of the one is trivial; the sense of the other is not. Let me be as clear as possible on what I am saying. Kaplan argues that T and T* encode the very same proposition (Fred is in p at t). That is well and good (I happen to think it is correct). But be that as it may, T and T* certainly have very different cognitive values. So they have very different senses (sense just is cognitive value). So here we have a text-book example of a case where Frege’s notion of sense applies. If we wish to remain loyal to a position that is even remotely Fregean, we must say that T and T* differ in sense. What I am now going to argue is that the two senses in question pick out propositions (the same in each case). And I will also argue that the difference in sense derives, not from semantics, but from pre-semantics – from the work one must do to compute literal meaning.

Such a token is true as long as the speaker doesn’t manage to simultaneously be, and not be, in a single place. That is why that token is “logically true”, even though the corresponding proposition is not. A Fregean would say that the “sense” of T is trivial. We’ve seen that what is trivial is the information through which one grasps the proposition literally meant by T. So the sense just mentioned picks out a proposition. The thing literally meant by T is some proposition. The “sense” of T is the information which enables one to single out that proposition. So the sense of T is something that singles out a proposition. The Fregean view is that the referent of an expression is the thing which the sense of that expression singles out. So if we insist on saying that T has a denotation, then application of the sense-reference distinction forces us to say that the denotation is the proposition meant by T. The sense is pre-semantics; the referent is semantics (literal meaning, the proposition literally meant).

And it is also strongly suggested that sentences do refer to their truth-values. Let us now evaluate this argument. One problem lies with (LL). As we’ve seen, use of (LL) in this context is question-begging. (LL) nearly enough embodies the assumption that sentences don’t refer to propositions, and is thus question-begging. It seems pretty clear that necessarily equivalent sentences can express very different propositions: “triangles have three sides”, “1+1=2”, “there are infinitely many primes”. So if sentences do refer to propositions, then logically equivalent sentences don’t co-refer. Thus if (LL) is to be of any use to somebody trying to argue that sentences refer to truth-values, that person must assume at the outset that sentences don’t refer to propositions. But this is not something that can be assumed in such a context. So (LL) is not a permissible assumption in this context. Also, a case can be made that the use of (CR) in the context of Church’s argument is question-begging. As we just saw, someone who is arguing that sentences refer to truth-values cannot presuppose that they don’t refer to propositions. And as we saw earlier, the Slingshot presupposes that the meaning of a sentence, i.e. the proposition it expresses, can be changed by intersubstituting co-referring terms. But if sentences refer to propositions, then such substitutions do change the referent of a sentence. So if (CR) is to be used in this context, it must be assumed that sentences do not refer to propositions. But this assumption is question-begging. The counter-response would be this: “It is clear on independent grounds that (CR) holds in extensional contexts; and the intersubstitutions involved in the Slingshot occur in extensional contexts”.

Intersubstitutions of co-referring terms cannot change reference. So reference has been preserved during the journey from (i) to (v), and so has truth-value. Thus it is natural to identify sentence-truth-value with sentence-reference. (Of course, there are other semantically significant properties that both (i) and (v) have in common; for example, they are both in English.

Here we must remember one of the points we made when we were discussing this argument earlier. Consider G4. If we reject (SS), then (G4) is simply false. Consider the sentence: “the unique x such that x=Socrates and x is bald is identical with Socrates”. If (SS) is false, then that sentence encodes the proposition Socrates is identical with Socrates. In that case, it is not logically equivalent with “Socrates is bald”. So Gödel’s Slingshot presuppose the truth of SS. So, for the sake of argument, let us suppose that (SS) is right. In that case, the other premises are inconsistent with another. First of all, the term “signification” is ambiguous between “meaning” and “denotation”. If by “signification” is meant “meaning”, then G1 is straightforwardly false, if one accepts (SS). “The first post-master general=the inventor of bifocals” is true. But, given (SS), the meaning of “the first post-master general” is not identical with the meaning of “the inventor of bifocals”. So, since we are supposing (SS) to be true, we must take “signification” to mean “denotation”. If we do that, then G1 is indeed true. But then G2 becomes either false or question-begging. Consider the sentence “the first post-master general=the inventor of bifocals”. It is by no means clear whether it has a denotation. If that is the case, then there is no function that assigns it a denotation (at least no function that assigns it the denotation that it actually has). So if G2 is to hold, it must be assumed that sentences do denote. But even this assumption is not enough to make G2 be true. G2 is to the effect that the denotation assigned to “the first post-master general=the inventor of bifocals” is a function only of the denotations of the components of that sentence, and not of their meanings. But what if sentences denote propositions? In that case, “the first post-master general=the inventor of bifocals” will not refer to the same thing as “the first post-master general= the first post-master general”; and the referent of a sentence will be a function of the meanings of its components, and not (just) of their referents.

    "text": "Frege has another argument for the view that sentences refer to truth-values. Reference is invariant with respect to intersubstitutions of co-referring terms. “The father of Cicero” has the same referent as “the father of Tully”. (In this context, to help motivate Frege’s point, let us assume that definite descriptions are singular terms.) In some contexts – so-called truth-functional ones - truth-value is invariant with respect to intersubstitutions of materially equivalent sentence-tokens: “coal is black and grass is green” has the same truth-value as “snow is white and grass is green”. So the facts about reference-preservation seem to parallel those about truth-value-preservation, suggesting that sentence-token-reference is truth-value. There are two problems with this argument. As Frege well knew, truth-value is not invariant with respect to intersubstitutions of materially equivalent sentence-tokens in non-truth-functional contexts. “Fred believes that snow is white” is true, but “Fred believes that there are more reals than rationals” is false. It is only in truth-functional contexts that such intersubstitutions work. But a “truth-functional” context is by definition one where such intersubstitutions work. An operator is truth-functional exactly if, for any sentence s falling in its scope, replacing s with a materially equivalent sentence doesn’t affect the truth-value of the host-sentence. So Frege is indeed right that truth-value is preserved by intersubstitutions of material equivalents in truth-functional contexts. But that point amounts to: truth-value is preserved by intersubstitutions of material equivalents in contexts where it preserves truth-value – or, more simply: such intersubstitutions preserve truth-value – except when they don’t. So facts about truth-value preservation parallel those about reference-preservation – except when they don’t. The truth is that such intersubstitutions tend not to preserve truth-value. The only connectives that are truth-functional are “not”, “and”, “or”, “it is true that” (and those that can be manufactured on their basis – e.g. “it is true that it is true…”). Causal, temporal, moral, modal, epistemic, and explanatory connectives are not truth-functional. Replacing “Kennedy died” in “Kennedy died because/after Kennedy was shot” with a materially equivalent sentence does not preserve truth-value: “Lincoln died because/after Kennedy was shot” is false. So it is more the exception than the rule for intersubstitutions of material equivalents to preserve truth-value; and the fact that truth-value is thus preserved in “truth-functional” contexts is an innocuous tautology. But even if we leave aside this last point, Frege’s argument is still less than probative. For the sake of argument, suppose...",

    "text": "Our consideration of the Slingshot is not yet complete; for there is a relevant subtlety that we have yet to consider. Some background will help to identify that subtlety. Russell held that definite descriptions are quantifiers. And, in Russell’s view, this meant that they don’t refer to anything. Of course, if Russell is right, and definite descriptions don’t refer to anything, then the Slingshot fails. The Slingshot assumes that definite descriptions can co-refer. If definite descriptions don’t refer to anything, then no two of them refer to the same thing, and no definite description refers to the same thing as a proper name. So no two definite descriptions co-refer, and no definite description co-refers with a proper name. And that would immediately void every form of the Slingshot. Our primary argument against the Slingshot did not presuppose the truth of Russell’s theory of descriptions. That argument had this form. Either that theory is correct or it isn’t. If it is correct, then the Slingshot fails (as we just saw). If it is false, then definite descriptions are singular terms, and the Slingshot fails (for entirely different reasons). But Richard Montague powerfully argued for a thesis that, if correct, apparently shows that argument to embody a fallacy. In this section, I will identify that thesis and show why, even if it is correct, in no way threatens our argument. Montague’s point is this. Quantifiers can be regarded as referring terms. This must be understood aright. Russell and Frege showed conclusively that “a man” does not refer to some mysterious “ambiguous” man; and they showed the same thing (mutatis mutandis) of “no man”, “every man”, and so on. “No man” doesn’t refer to some kind of blank man. It doesn’t refer to any man. Montague agrees with this unreservedly. Here is where Montague and Russell disagree. Russell took these facts about “a man”, and other quantifiers, to show that they don’t refer at all. Montague argued that quantifiers do refer. They don’t refer to individuals, but they do refer to functions. Consider the concept x is bald. This is true for certain objects (e.g. Socrates) and false for other others (e.g. Lincoln). So this concept can be seen as a function that pairs off individuals with truth-values. It pairs off an individual x with the truth-value true if x is bald and pairs off x with the truth-value false if x is...",

So (i) and (ii) are supposed to co-refer by (CR). (iii) and (ii) are supposed to co-refer for the same reason. Supposing that definite descriptions denote functions, then “Scott” obviously doesn’t co-refer with “the author of Waverly”. “Scott” refers to a person, not a function. And “the author of Waverly” would not co-refer with “the man who wrote twenty-nine Waverly novels altogether.” Suppose that definite descriptions denote functions. Let F be the function denoted by “the author of Waverly”. Let F* be the function denoted by “the man who wrote twenty-nine Waverly novels altogether.” F assigns truth to a class C exactly if two conditions are met: first, there is exactly one author of Waverly; second any author of Waverly falls into C. F* assigns truth to a class C exactly if two conditions are met: first, there is exactly one author of twenty-nine Waverly novels; second, any such author falls into C. There are worlds where F assigns truth to a given class and F* assigns falsity to that same class. So F and F* are different functions. Imagine a world w where the following holds. In w, Scott is bald. And in w, Scott wrote Waverly, but nobody wrote twenty-nine Waverly novels. (Scott decided to stop writing Waverly novels after writing the first two.) In w, F assigns truth to the concept x is bald (and also to various other concepts: x is identical with Scott, x is not a round square). But, in w, F* assigns falsity to every class. After all, in w, nothing wrote twenty-nine Waverly novels altogether; so in w there is no class C satisfying the two conditions mentioned a moment ago.

So in that world, “for some x” assigns truth to the class of men over 9ft tall.

In w1, it is associated with the pair <men over 9ft tall, falsity>; in w2 it is associated with the pair <men over 9ft tall, falsity>; yet in both worlds, it denotes the same function. But we must not say that. A given function cannot be associated with different sets of ordered pairs. A function determines a single set of ordered pairs: different sets of ordered pairs, different functions. If we say that “for some x” has the same semantics in different worlds, then we are saying that it denotes the same function, and is thus associated with the same set of ordered pairs, in different worlds. So it is a contradiction in terms to say that “for some x” has the same semantics in worlds where it is associated with different ordered pairs.

This problem is not hard to deal with. Let C1 be the class of men over 9ft tall in w1, and let C2 be the class of men over 9ft tall in w2. “For some x” does not have the class of men over 9ft tall for an argument. There is no such class.

But it has never been said what exactly it would be for a sentence to “refer” to a truth-value or a fact. In fact, what Frege said about the concept of number, and its relation to mathematics, holds equally of the concept of reference and its relation to semantics. In Frege’s time, no one had bothered to ask the question “what is a number?” In our time, no one has ever said: “this is what reference is; this is what it is for ‘Socrates’ to refer to Socrates; and the relation that holds between those two things is identical with the relation that holds between sentences and truth-values (or facts or situations…)” In this chapter, I want to propose an answer to the question: “what is reference?” I will start by stating the proposal I wish to defend.",

But to expedite discussion, let us idealize away from this nicety.) What does this involve? If you say “Socrates was bald”, you are attributing baldness to Socrates. If you say “Plato punched Socrates”, you are saying of Socrates that Plato punched him. Suppose that “Socrates was bald” did not attribute baldness to Socrates. Suppose that, in general, *Socrates has phi* did not attribute phi to Socrates, but that otherwise English semantic rules were unchanged. In that case, “Socrates” wouldn’t refer to Socrates at all. Here is what we have so far. It is a datum that “Socrates” refers to Socrates. It is also a datum that, for any phi, if a sentence has the form *Socrates has phi*, then that sentence attributes phi to Socrates. Surely these facts are related. Let us move on. Suppose that “Socrates was bald” meant Charlemagne was bald, but that otherwise the rules of English semantics were unchanged. In that case, “Socrates” would presumably refer to Charlemagne, at least in that particular context. Suppose that, for any phi, tokens of *Socrates had phi* attributed phi to Charlemagne. In that case, presumably, “Socrates” would refer to Charlemagne, not to Socrates. Here is what we have so far. If *Socrates has phi* did not attribute phi to Socrates, then “Socrates” would not refer to Socrates. So if “Socrates” is to refer to Socrates, it is necessary that *Socrates has phi* attribute phi to Socrates. This condition is also sufficient. If sentences of the form *Socrates has phi* meant that Charlemagne has phi, then (holding constant all the remaining semantic rules of English) “Socrates” would refer to Charlemagne. In general, for any object O, if *Socrates has phi* attributed phi to O, then (holding constant all the remaining semantic rules of English) “Socrates” would refer to O. So given that sentences of that form mean that Socrates has phi, it follows “Socrates” refers to Socrates. Here is the general principle that falls out of this. For “Socrates” to refer to Socrates, it is necessary and sufficient that *Socrates has phi* attribute phi to Socrates. Thus “Socrates” refers to Socrates exactly if *Socrates has phi* attributes phi to Socrates. Given this, it is tempting to put forth the following generalization:",

It is worth bringing up because it seems very plausible, and because the problems we find in it will motivate the positive analysis I wish to defend.

I believe that, strictly speaking, (#) is no more about Franklin than “sometimes two and two don’t make four” is about Smith.

So either it doesn’t refer to anything or it refers to a function. If we say that “the teacher of Aristotle” contributes a concept, then we must embrace Russell’s theory. The essence of that theory is: definite descriptions do not refer to individuals; they are quantifiers. By exactly similar reasoning, if we say “the author of the Republic” contributes a sense, we are saying that it is a quantifier. In that case, it either refers to a function or it doesn’t refer to anything. If “the author of the Republic” and “the teacher of Aristotle” contribute different senses, it is because they don’t co-refer. If, as Russell thought, they don’t refer to anything, then they don’t co-refer. If they refer to functions, they refer to different functions, as we saw earlier. If those descriptions are quantifiers, they are different quantifiers, and thus don’t co-refer. A corollary is that replacing a definite description with a co-referring definite description cannot result in a change in meaning. Replacing “the author of the Republic” with “the teacher of Aristotle” results in a change of meaning only if those expressions denote different entities (different functions). It follows that, if definite descriptions are singular terms, they semantically contribute nothing more and nothing less than their referents. Let us sum up this leg of the discussion.

(A) and (B) are thus ambiguous. (I leave it open whether this is a matter of pragmatics or semantics. An obvious extension of Kripke’s (1977) argument would suggest that it is pragmatic.) But for any reading of (A) and (B), replacing “rhenates” with “chordates” results in meaning-change only if “rhenates” and “chordates” denote different functions. Really, this is a triviality. A sense or concept just is a function: from objects (or worlds) to truth-values. If expressions contribute different concepts, then they denote different functions. A corollary is that under no circumstance can meaning be changed by replacing a referring term with a co-referring term. It follows that, if a term refers to something, it semantically contributes that thing and that thing alone. § We are now in a position to put forth what I think may be an adequate conception of reference:",

    "text": "(RF) accommodates the fact that expressions other than nouns may refer. For example, the expression “snores” is plausibly seen as denoting the property of snoring. (This is not all that it does; that is why that expression is not interchangeable with “the property of snoring”. But it is hard to deny that part of what occurrences of “snores” do is to pick out, and thus refer to, that bodily function.) In virtue of having the form “…snores…”, a sentence-token is about that property. A token of “Plato snores” says that Plato has that property, and is therefore about that property (among other things). Let me provide an intuitive basis for (RF). As Dummett said, if E refers to O, then sentences of the form “…E…” are about O. If “Socrates was wise” were not about Socrates, then “Socrates” wouldn’t refer to Socrates. So for “Socrates” to refer to Socrates, it is necessary that sentences (or sentence-tokens, rather) of the form “…Socrates…” be about Socrates, i.e. encode propositions that concern him. But the converse appears not to hold. Arguably, sentences of the form “…a great philosopher who died of hemlock poisoning…” are about Socrates. But they do not, in virtue of having that form, contain any parts that refer to Socrates. So aboutness appears not to be enough for reference. But a certain, very strict kind of aboutness is enough for reference. We know that tokens of “Socrates” refer to Socrates. This is a paradigm of reference. And we know that, in virtue of having the form “…Socrates…”, a sentence-token encodes a proposition that has Socrates as a constituent. Any such proposition is about Socrates in a maximally strong sense. (I myself believe that this is the only sense in which, strictly speaking, a proposition can be about a thing. But I leave that aside for right now.) So if we confine ourselves to this strong sense of “about”, the following seems to hold: E refers to O exactly if, in virtue of having the form “…E…”, a sentence-token encodes a proposition that is about O in the strong sense just mentioned, i.e. that proposition has O as a constituent. It is easy to find additional support for this view. We know that in some cases, E’s referring to O involves sentences of the form “…E…” encoding propositions that have O as a constituent.

But it would obviously be false to say that on the whole it was an expression that referred to Plato. It is an expression that, on the whole, refers to a proposition about Plato; and it does this by being, in part, an expression that refers to Plato. So (RF) is actually borne out by consideration of that expression. Still, the objector’s point does require us to clarify a point. E is an expression that on the whole refers to O exactly if two conditions are met. First, in virtue of having the form “…E…” a sentence-token encodes a proposition that is about O (i.e. that has O has a constituent). Second, there is no object O* (distinct from O) such that, in virtue of having the form “…E…”, a sentence-token encodes a proposition that is about O*.

I think that the term “denotation” is actually ambiguous. I believe that (RF) is one legitimate disambiguation of it; but it is not the only one. Acknowledging the ambiguity of the term “denotation” is crucial to answering many difficult questions. Do expressions other than nouns refer? Does the “snores” in “Plato snores” refer to anything? Does it refer to a property or function? Or does it not refer at all? Is the relation that holds between “snores” and (say) the property of snoring entirely different from the relation between tokens of “Plato” and Plato? Are grammatical differences referentially significant? Supose that Smith tokens a “me” and later tokens an “I”. It seems a datum, nearly enough, that those tokens co-refer. But they have different grammatical roles. Is there a way of reducing those grammatical differences to referential differences? Perhaps, strictly speaking, those tokens don’t co-refer; perhaps they refer to different functions (each involving Smith). What about connective expressions like “and”, “if…then…”, “because”? It seems fair to say that “if…then…” refers to the relation of consequence. But is the relation of that expression to the consequence-relation comparable to the relation of tokens of “Plato” to Plato? Or are we dealing with a different relation altogether? Would we be hyper-extending the notion of reference if we said that, indeed, tokens of “if…then…” do refer to the consequence relation? And would we be hyper-extending the notion of reference if we say that tokens of “and” do refer to some function (e.g. one assigning truth to a pair of propositions or sentences exactly if both of them are true)? We’ve seen that forceless sentence-tokens seem to refer to propositions. But what about forced sentence-tokens? Do they refer to anything? Here is an outline of my answer. On one disambiguation of the term “denotation”, grammatical differences are not referentially significant. The tokens of “I” and “me” mentioned a moment ago simply co-refer.. They both refer to Smith; neither refers to a function. End of story. On the other disambiguation, grammatical differences are referentially significant.

Just as baldness is a property of Socrates, so propositions are properties of worlds. A proposition is true in a world just in case the corresponding property is instantiated there. So propositions are properties and truth is instantiatedness. Just as a person may or may not have the property of baldness, so a world might or might not have the property corresponding to a given proposition. (Of course, some propositions are necessarily true. e.g. squares are square. But this doesn’t indicate that propositions are not properties. After all, some properties are necessarily had by all things. For example, any individual x is such that x either is, or is not square-shaped.) If this is right, then a proposition is the kind of that thing that can be instantiated. This suggests (though it doesn’t strictly imply) that the components of propositions must also be things that can be instantiated. Here we have a problem. It is generally held that Caesar himself is a constituent of (CM). But Caesar is not the sort of thing that can be instantiated. This points to a more general problem. A proposition has structure; it is essential to a proposition that its components be arranged in a certain way. Otherwise there is no distinction between John loves Mary and Mary loves John. Given this, if we think of propositions as things that have for their constituents actual bits of the spatiotemporal world – actual people, murders, snorings, and so on – then we end up making propositions be perilously close to the states of affairs that make them true. The proposition John loves Mary ends up being a structure that comprises John, loving, and Mary in a certain arrangement; and the order is presumably one whereby John is loving Mary. But in that case, the proposition John loves Mary becomes the state of affairs that would make it true; it becomes a case of John’s loving Mary; so that proposition becomes automatically true. But obviously that proposition could be false. So if we think of individuals as components of propositions, then it becomes impossible to account for the structural properties of propositions without incurring the absurd result that propositions become automatically true.

But what is relevant here is not whether they have correctly interpreted Frege, but only whether the theories they put forth are correct. If I am reading him correctly, Dummett (1973: 192-197) unwittingly puts forth two distinct theories of reference. His first theory appears to be this. When we say that “Plato” refers to Plato, we are presumably saying that sentences of the form “…Plato…” are ipso facto about Plato. It would be absurd to say: “Plato” refers to Plato; but if you want to make a statement about Plato, you’d better not use that expression; for sentences of the form “…Plato…” aren’t about Plato. It would also be absurd to say that sentences of the form “…Plato…” are ipso facto about Plato, but “Plato” doesn’t refer to Plato. It seems, then, that “Plato” refers to Plato just in case sentences of the form “…Plato…” are ipso facto about Plato. So we might as well say that for “Plato” to refer to Plato just is for it to be the case that sentences having the form “…Plato…” are ipso facto about Plato. Give or take some nuances relating to the word “about”, this is pretty much identical with the theory of reference we put forth. But Dummett conflates this plausible theory with a most implausible one. If the theory put forth a moment ago is right, then “Plato” is really to be defined contextually: for “Plato” to refer to Plato is for sentences of the form “…Plato…” to have certain meanings or truth-conditions. (For some reason, Dummett talks about truth-conditions, not meanings. In this context, this difference is innocuous. But, for the record, I think it is preferable to talk about meanings. I think that truth-conditions are too course-grained. The meaning of “1+1=2” is different from the meaning of “triangles have three sides”. But any circumstance or “condition” sufficient for the truth of the one is sufficient for the truth of the other.) Given what we said a moment ago, it seems fair to say that “Plato” refers to Plato exactly if the occurrence of “Plato” in a sentence S has a certain effect on the truth-conditions of S.

If an expression E has such and such an effect on the truth-conditions of sentences in which it occurs, let us say that E has such and such a “truth-valence”. It would be hard to deny that if sentences of the form “…Plato…” weren’t about Plato, then “Plato” wouldn’t refer to Plato. It would also be hard to deny that if sentences of the form “…Charlemagne…” were ipso facto about Plato, then “Charlemagne” would refer to Plato. So it is hard to deny that an expression refers to Plato exactly if that expression has a certain truth-valence. But it doesn’t follow that every aspect of a word’s truth-valence is relevant to its reference. Words can co-refer but not have entirely coincident truth-valences. What is needed is only that their truth-valences coincide in the relevant respect. The word “wet” refers to the property of being wet, and so does “the property of being wet”. Why does the first refer to that property? Because a sentence of the form “…wet…” ipso facto encodes propositions one of whose constituents is the property of wetness. Mutatis mutandis “the property of being wet” refers to that property for the same reason. So those words have the same referent because in the relevant respect they have the same truth-valence. But in other respects they have different truth-valences. Replacing “wet” with “the property of being”, or vice versa, can strip a sentence of truth-condition and, conversely, can give truth-conditions to a hitherto meaningless heap of words. So it is patently obvious that “wet” and “the property of being wet” have different truth-valences. This point can be made with more effect with a highly inflected language like Latin. It is pretty much a datum that “Brutus” and “Brutum” and “Brute” co-refer – they all refer to Brutus. But they have different truth-valences. “Brutus est malus” has truth-conditions; “Brutum est malus” does not (since it is poorly formed). So it is easy to over-state the connection between reference and truth-valence. Suppose that E refers to O. It is true that E refers to O exactly if E has a certain effect on the truth-conditions of sentences in which it occurs – exactly if it has a certain truth-valence.

What is it for tokens of “Plato” to refer to Plato? Here we don’t need an analysis of the concept of reference: a few platitudes will do. If a sentence-token has the form “…Plato…”, it is ipso facto about Plato. A token of “Plato snored” means: Plato snored. If it meant that Charlemagne snored, then (holding constant the remaining rules of English), “Plato” would refer to Charlemagne. If a sentence is of the form “…red…” or “…snores…”, it is ipso facto about the property of redness or of being a snorer. “Plato snores” is about the property of snoring – it says that Plato has that property. “Smith’s car is red” is about the property of redness – it says that Smith’s car has that property.

Let’s consider these possibilities. Let T be an arbitrary forced token of “Mozart wrote music”. Suppose we say that T refers to the corresponding proposition. The first thing to do is compare it to something we know to refer to that proposition, e.g. a token of “that Mozart wrote music”. Let T* be an arbitrary token of “that Mozart wrote music”. There are some obvious differences between T and T*. T* can occur as part of a sentence; T cannot. Now T certainly has much in common with T*. Both somehow indicate the proposition that Mozart wrote music. But T does more than this: T affirms that proposition – it doesn’t merely indicate it. By contrast, T does not affirm (or deny) it; it merely indicates it. It is clear that, by itself, referring to a proposition doesn’t involve affirming it or denying it. That is why T* can occur in the context of a sentence-token that denies the proposition Mozart wrote music (e.g. “it is false that Mozart wrote music”) or in the context of a proposition that is neutral on the question whether that proposition is true (“if it is the case that Mozart wrote music, then somebody wrote music”) or in the context of a sentence-token that ascribes truth to it (“it is true that Mozart wrote music”). So, clearly, referring to a proposition does not by itself constitute affirming it or denying it (or doing anything else with it). So to the extent that T does affirm that proposition, it plainly does something other than just refer to it. I myself think it is plausible, or at least not obviously false, to maintain that part of what T does is to refer to it. Obviously T affirms that proposition. In order to do that, it must somehow indicate it; and this, it seems to me (though it won’t so seem to others), is not so different from referring to it. But it is also plain that T does something other than indicating it: it also affirms it. So it would be wrong to say that on the whole T is a singular term that refers to a proposition. Of course, T comprises constituents that...",

    "text": "§ A similar argument shows that it would be false to say that on the whole T is a singular term that refers to a fact or state of affairs. Referring seems to be something you do when existence is taken for granted; affirming is something you do when existence is not taken for granted. If you say “there is a king of France…”, you are, in so doing, affirming the existence of something, and thus not referring to that thing. (The affirmation of existence can, perhaps, be used as the basis for a later reference to that thing, as in: “there is a king of France. And that guy is really well-read.” But the affirmation of existence itself is not a case of referring to him.) But if you use an expression that is meant to simply pick out or refer to that thing, that means that, from your point of view, the question of existence has been settled. So it is clear that in affirming the existence of the fact that Mozart wrote music, you are doing something other than referring to that fact. Let T# be a token of “the fact that Mozart wrote music”. For the reason just given, it doesn’t seem quite right to say that, in using T#, you are saying that it is a fact that Mozart wrote music. It seems that you are taking it for granted. The question whether that fact exists has been settled. But when you utter a forced token of “Mozart wrote music”, that is plainly because that very question has not been settled: in making that utterance, you are in the process of settling it. So to the extent that T does affirm the existence of the fact that Mozart wrote music, it does something other than merely refer to that fact. And it is obviously essential to T that it does this extra, non-referring something. What makes something be a sentence, as opposed to a nominal (like “that Mozart wrote music”) is precisely that it constitutes an explicit affirmation of some fact, as opposed to a presupposition of it. So, once again, to the extent that T affirms the existence of that fact, it does something more, or other than, refer to it. So it would not be correct to say that T was a singular term that referred to a fact. There is also the...",

Let T^ be a token of an expression that we know to refer to the truth-value True (so far as we know this of any expression): let it be a token of “the truth-value True”. First of all, the relationship which T^ bears to that truth-value isn’t remotely like the relation which T bears to it. For one thing, T^ can, while T cannot, be a proper part of a sentence-token. If you want to ascribe the property of being made of peanut-butter to that truth-value, you embed “the truth-value True” in the right kind of sentence-token, to wit: “the truth-value True is made of peanut-butter”. If you want to ascribe that property to all propositions of the form P or not P, you can do so by embedding that expression in the right kind of sentence-token: “the truth-value True is had by all propositions of the form P or not P.” But you cannot use tokens (whether forced or forceless) of “Mozart wrote music” in this way. It is not out of the question to suppose that part of what a forced token of “Mozart wrote music” does is to indicate that truth-value. After all, such a token affirms and (it arguably follows) ascribes that truth-value to proposition. So, perhaps, at some level, in some way, a forced token of “Mozart wrote music” refers to the truth-value True. But that is obviously not all it does. A token of “the truth-value True” clearly refers to that truth-value (if anything does). But merely by using a token of “the truth-value True” in a sentence, you have not necessarily ascribed that truth-value to anything; perhaps you used that expression for precisely the opposite reason (“no proposition of the form P and not P has the truth-value True”); or perhaps you are using that expression precisely to express your neutrality as to its applicability (“it is unknown to me whether there are expressions of the form P and not P that have the truth-value True”). So it is plain that merely by virtue of referring to the truth-value True, you have not affirmed that it applies to some proposition (or that it does not apply).

Under no circumstances are the truth-values of S and S* part of what they semantically contribute to “S and S*”.

Merely by virtue of referring to a proposition, you have not affirmed anything – if you say “that snow is white”, you haven’t said anything true or false (though you have denoted something true or false). But merely by virtue of saying “snow is white”, you have said something true or false. This difference appears not to be a merely grammatical one; it is not comparable to the difference between saying “I like to play soccer” and “me like to play soccer” or to the difference between saying “if that snow is white, then something is white” and “if snow is white, then something is white”. So it seems false to say that, on the whole, forced sentence-tokens refer to propositions. By an exactly similar argument, we can show that, on the whole, forced-sentence tokens don’t refer to states of affairs or truth-values. In fact, we can show that, for any object O, a forced token of “snow is white” doesn’t refer to O. Consider some expression that uncontroversially refers to O – for example *O*. Merely by virtue of uttering *O*, you haven’t said anything true or false. So utterances of *O* differ in an important respect from utterances of “snow is white”.

    "text": "§ Black never says why replacing a referring term with a co-referring term ought to preserve meaningfulness. He simply asserts it. Right now I’d like to give what I believe is the motivation behind Black’s thesis. This will provide us with a more nuanced conception of the semantic notions that relate to our inquiry. Here is what I believe to be the rationale behind (BP). First of all, propositions are never meaningless; a proposition is a meaning. Expressions are meaningful or meaningless. A proposition is the meaning of a sentence – a meaningless sentence is one that does not encode a proposition. Given this, consider the proposition: that Plato loves Socrates. This proposition has constituents – Socrates, the relation of loving, and Plato. That sentence can be expressed in a sentence: “Socrates loves Plato”. “Socrates” picks out Socrates, “Plato” picks out Plato, and “loves” picks out the relation of loving. Suppose you replace “Socrates” with a co-referring expression. The new expression does the same thing as the old one -- the same constituent is picked out. So the proposition hasn’t changed: there has been no change in its constituency. Thus the new sentence and the old sentence bear the same proposition and are equally meaningful. There is a crucial non-sequitur in this argument. Some background is needed to expose it. A proposition is not a heap of constituents. It has structure; its constituents are ordered in a certain way. (I remain resolutely silent on the nature of this ordering: it is clearly not anything like a mere spatio-temporal ordering.) The ordinal properties of a proposition are not reducible to facts about its constituency. The difference between Plato loves Socrates and Socrates loves Plato is not that they have different constituents. For the sake of argument, suppose the first proposition consisted of four constituents: Plato, Socrates, the relation of loving, and x – x may be anything you choose. Clearly the set (Plato, Socrates, the relation of loving, x) is no proposition. No matter how many new constituents we add to that set, we won’t produce a proposition. So the ordinal properties of a proposition do not reduce to facts about its constituents. It follows that the ordinal differences between Plato loves Socrates and Socrates loves Plato do not amount to a difference in their constituencies. This point about propositions has a semantic counterpart. As Frege himself remarked, a sentence is...",

    "text": "§ We are trying to figure out to what, if anything, sentence-tokens refer. The problem is that, while we have solid intuitions about reference when it comes to certain expressions, we have at most weak and indecisive ones when it comes to others. Does “but” refer? What about “and”? Intuition is silent. Intuition is equally silent when it comes to whole sentence-tokens. But, I believe, an analysis of reference falls out of our discussion of Black’s principle. We’ve made a case that Plato loves Socrates has exactly the same constituents as Socrates loves Plato. In connection with this, we saw some reason to believe that there is no referential difference between “loves” and “the relation of loving”, even though there is a semantic difference. Thus, “loves” refers to the relation of loving because that relation is a constituent of the propositions encoded in “Plato loves Socrates”, “Socrates loves Plato”, and the like. The difference between “loves” and “to love” has nothing to do with what is referred to -- nothing to do with a difference in the corresponding propositional constituents. In both cases we are dealing with the same constituent; what differs is that constituent’s relation to its fellow constituents. So, to a first approximation, we may analyze reference thus: E refers to O exactly if a sentence-token containing E ipso facto encodes a proposition one of whose constituents is O. This last statement has to be refined. If the expression “that snow is white” occurs in a sentence S, S ipso facto encodes a proposition one of whose constituents is snow. But the referent of “that snow is white” is a proposition, not snow. This is easy to correct. There is a unique x such that, if S comprises “that snow is white”, the proposition meant by S ipso facto comprises x and such that, for any y such that S ipso facto includes y, y is a constituent of x. x, of course, is the proposition that snow is white. So E refers to O exactly if two conditions are met (we will refer to this analysis of reference as R1).",

That description has a sense: murderer of Smith. In so far as that sense makes it into the proposition meant by “the man who murdered Smith is rich”, the definite description is functioning attributively. In so far as the definite description is functioning attributively, that sentence means: somebody uniquely murdered Smith and any such person is rich. So in so far as it is functioning attributively, “the man who murdered Smith” is a quantifier, not an expression that refers to Plato. Now suppose that “the man who murdered Smith” is functioning referentially in “the man who murdered Smith is rich”. In that case, the concept man who murdered Smith serves not as a constituent of the proposition, but merely as a way of picking out some such constituent. Of course, the constituent in question is Fred; and the proposition in question is simply Fred is rich. So in so far as the definite description is functioning referentially, Fred himself is a constituent of the proposition meant by “Fred is right.” Thus in so far as the concept man who murdered Smith is part of what is meant by a token of “the man who murdered Smith is rich”, the definite description is a quantifier, not a singular term. In so far as the definite description is not functioning as a quantifier, that sentence-token means simply: Fred is rich, Fred himself being a constituent of its meaning. An exactly similar argument applies to “Plato”. For the sake of argument, suppose with Frege that “Plato” has a sense or concept – say, inventor of the theory of Forms. In that case, “Plato” is synonymous with “the inventor of the theory of Forms”. This means we can map everything we just said about “the murderer of Fred” onto “Plato”.

If sentences having that form were ipso facto about Charlemagne, then “Plato” would presumably refer to Charlemagne. This point works in the other direction: if sentences of the form “…Charlemagne…” were ipso facto about Plato, then “Charlemagne” would refer to Plato. Another illustration: Sentence-tokens having the form “…red…” are ipso facto about the property of redness. If such sentences were ipso facto about Plato or about the property of green, then “red” would refer to that person or that property. So it seems E refers to O exactly if sentence-tokens having the form “…E…” are ipso facto about O. Thus R2 apparently corresponds to our intuitions about reference fairly well. R2 might seem superior to R1 in certain respects. R1 is committed to the controversial doctrine known as direct-reference theory: when “Plato” occurs in S, Plato himself is a constituent of the proposition meant by S. By contrast, R2 seems neutral on this. For “Plato” to refer to Plato, it isn’t necessary that Plato be a constituent of the proposition meant by “Plato was bald. The proposition need only be about Plato: it is left open how this “aboutness” is to be accomplished. Perhaps Plato himself is a constituent, perhaps not – perhaps only a sense that applies to Plato is such a constituent. But I think the advantage that R2 has over R1 is illusory, and that R1 is preferable. Suppose that Fred kissed Sally and that no one else did. In that case, the sentence “some man kissed Sally” is true. Nothing in that sentence refers to Fred. At the same time, it is not unreasonable to say that that sentence is about Fred. The expression “some man” is such that, in virtue of its occurrence there, that sentence is “about” Fred. But “some man” doesn’t refer to Fred. So R2 seems too permissive. The counter-response is to say this. “Fred kissed Sally” is “about” Fred in a far stricter sense than “some man kissed Sally”. The latter isn’t really about Fred at all. It is made true by some fact about Fred. But it is not really about him, at least not in a strict sense. There are possible worlds where “some man kissed Sally” is true, but...",

But when (2) expresses a proposition like (3), “the True” doesn’t function as an expression that refers to the property of truth. It functions rather as a quantifier. (Thus, depending on one’s views on quantifiers, it is functioning either as something that doesn’t refer at all or as something that refers to a second-level function.) The difference between “snow is white” and “the True” isn’t remotely like the difference between “I” and “me”. In the one case, we are dealing with something that is plausibly seen as a mere grammatical difference. In other cases, we are dealing with a much deeper difference: a difference that is reflected in, but not confined to, a grammatical difference. There is a subtler point to make here. Arguably, grammatical differences are semantic differences. There are grammatical differences between “red” and “John”. You can say “John smokes”, but not “red smokes”. (“The property of redness smokes” is false, perhaps even absurd, but perfectly grammatical. But “red smokes” is simply ungrammatical.) But these grammatical differences presumably reflect semantic differences. It could even be maintained (in fact, I will maintain it later) that these semantic differences reduce to differences in what the expressions in question pick out. The idea would be that the one picks out an individual, while the other picks out a function. To take another example: There are profound grammatical differences between “or” and “Smith”. But those differences obviously reflect semantic differences. And a case can be made (I will try to make it) that those semantic differences reduce to differences in what those expressions pick out. (“Or” picks out a higher-order function, “Smith” picks out an individual.) It is by no means clear that grammatical facts can ever be dismissed as merely grammatical – as semantically innocent. On the face of it, they seem to embody semantic facts; and grammatical categories seem to be semantic categories. When you say that “John” and “some man” are “noun phrases”, you are presumably making a statement about the semantic roles of such expressions. By this reasoning, when you say that “I” and “me” are grammatically different, you are saying something about their semantic roles.

They have said that various desiderata relating to uniformity, compositionality, and the like are naturally satisfied by stipulating that sentences of such languages “denote” truth-values. This thinking is generally thought unexceptionable. Who can argue with a stipulation? If Church stipulates that sentences of a formal language of his own making are to denote truth-values, then how can we possibly refute him? How can a convention be refuted? Of course, we could take issue with his assertion that the needs internal to his system legitimate that particular stipulation: we could say that, given the formal properties of that language, some other stipulation would be preferable. But who would want to argue with Church about the logical structure of his own language? Who, indeed, would want to go toe to toe with Church in the arena of formal logic? And who would dare confront him regarding the logic of his own language? I believe that this combination of reasoning and fear has led philosophers to concede to heavyweights like Church that, in formal languages, it is legitimate to stipulate that sentences refer to truth-values – indeed, it is legitimate to stipulate that they refer to anything we want them to. But not all stipulations are legitimate; some are illogical. An order cannot be true or false, but it can embody a falsity (e.g. “build me a round square”). The same is true of a stipulation. We’ve seen what it is for an expression to denote something. E denotes O exactly if, in virtue of having the form “…E…”, a sentence-token says something about (attributes some property) to O. “Plato” refers to Plato because *Plato has phi* means that Plato has phi. Now imagine an artificial language L with the following properties. The sentences of L have the same meanings as their English counterparts; so “snow is white” means snow is white, and so on. But in L, by our stipulation, “snow is white” denotes the truth value of its meaning. That stipulation is incoherent. In virtue of having the form “…snow is white…” a sentence (whether of L or of English) encodes a proposition that has the proposition that snow is white for a constituent; such a sentence does not, at least not in virtue of having...",

Actually, we will see some reason to believe that the difference is even more tenuous than this suggests. Arguably, tokens of “Plato” do denote functions, no less than “and”. The difference between tokens of “Plato” and tokens of “and” lies in what kind of functions they denote. The Augustinian conception of language, ridiculed by Wittgenstein, turns out to be quite right. Since reference reduces to semantic contribution, it follows that sentence-tokens refer to what they semantically contribute; they refer to what they mean. In any case, if one is to escape this conclusion, one must show that SC is wrong. But this does not appear to be possible.",

This is known as the “thesis of compositionality” or, simply, “compositionality”. Compositionality has been accepted by most, but not all. To my knowledge, it has always been regarded as a substantive thesis. I think that compositionality is correct. But I also think it is a truism, in the same category as “we can travel in time: at the rate of one second per second”. We have argued that, for (tokens of) “Socrates” to refer to Socrates just is for sentences of the form “…Socrates…” to have a certain meaning. If they don’t have that meaning, then “Socrates” didn’t refer to Socrates to begin with. There is no way that a sentence-token could not be a function of the meanings of its parts. An expression means such and such exactly if sentences containing it have certain meanings. So whatever meanings those sentences have, that fixes what the meaning of that expression is. Under no circumstance can we meaningfully, let alone truly, say that E means O but that “…E…” does not mean:…O…Compositionality is not a thesis about subsentential meaning; it merely identifies what subsentential meaning is.",

By our stipulation, “ze phi” refers to the unique phi, if there is such a thing, and to nothing if there isn’t. No evidence could provide any support for the view that “ze phi” is a quantifier. It is an analytic proposition that “ze phi” is not a quantifier; and nothing can constitute support for the negation of such a proposition. But the evidence that supposedly favors Russell’s theory equally favors the view that zefinite descriptions are quantifiers. “Ze inventor of bifocals snored” and “ze first post-master general snored” differ in cognitive value in exactly the same way as “the inventor of bifocals snored” and “the first post-master general snored”. That difference in cognitive value provides no support for the view that zefinite descriptions are quantifiers. So the corresponding fact about definite descriptions provides no rational support for Russell’s theory. Here is yet another way to look at it. Consider a community of people who speak a language we will call English*. English*-speakers speak and write exactly as we do, with this one possible difference. Wherever we use a definite description, an English*-speaker uses a zefinite description. But English*-zefinite descriptions are homonymous with English definite descriptions: they sound the same and are written the same. So the English*-translation of “ze inventor of bifocals” is “the inventor of bifocals”.

So if Russell’s theory is to be a correct conceptual analysis of (x), then “the inventor of bifocals” cannot be a singular term. It must be a quantifier: for any noun that is not a singular term is a quantifier. Which quantifier is it? For reasons discussed earlier, there is no doubt that if “the inventor of bifocals” is a quantifier, it is exactly the quantifier Russell has in mind. So if “the inventor of bifocals” is not a term that refers to Franklin, then it is, at the level of literal meaning, the kind of quantifier Russell has in mind. In that case, the literal meaning of (x) is (xii). So if Russell’s theory is to be a correct conceptual analysis, then it is necessary that the literal meaning of “…the phi…” be: exactly one x has phi and…x… So Russell’s theory is a correct conceptual analysis only if it is a correct semantic analysis – only if it gives literal meaning.

Now that we are clear about what Russell’s theory is really saying, it is easy to evaluate it and, indeed, to show that it is false. Kripke on descriptions Kripke (1977) makes exactly the opposite claim. Kripke acknowledges that there is some prima facie evidence suggesting that Russell’s analysis is wrong. For example, prima facie it does seem that, when you say, “the man over there smokes”, you are not saying: somebody or other is a unique man over there and any such man smokes. Rather, you are saying something of the form: so and so smokes. Kripke acknowledges these facts are apparent counterexamples to Russell’s theory. But he thinks that none of these apparent counter-examples are actual counter-examples. His argument is this. Let EnglishR be a language that is exactly like English except for this one possible difference. In English R, sentences of the form “…the phi…” are to be analyzed exactly as Russell says their English homonyms are to be analyzed. So in EnglishR, by our stipulation, “…the phi…” means: exactly one thing x has phi and…x… According to Kripke, the position that EnglishR definite descriptions are quantifiers would be subject to exactly the same apparent counter-examples as the thesis that English definite descriptions are quantifiers. In EnglishR, says Kripke, “…the phi…” would communicate the same thing as its English homonym; and there would be no discernible difference between English and EnglishR in respect of when it would be appropriate to say “…the phi…” as opposed to “there is some x such that x uniquely has phi and…x…” We know that EnglishR definite descriptions are quantifiers. Any apparent counter-examples to that thesis are merely apparent. So the above apparent counter-examples to Russell’s theory don’t show that Russell is wrong. After all, if by our stipulation, we were speaking a language of which Russell’s theory were true, the same apparent counter-examples would arise. Therefore those apparent counter-examples are innocuous. A corollary is that those apparent counter-examples to no degree show that we are not speaking EnglishR. On independent grounds, Kripke happens to think that we are not speaking EnglishR.

CTR says that such tokens refer to Socrates just in case they have a certain kind of causal relation to that man. There are other, less innocuous, qualifications. No one would maintain that (CTR) is meant to apply to all referring terms. Consider “the first animal born in the year 3000 A.D.” (If you think definite descriptions are quantifiers, then consider: “ze first animal born in the year 3000 A.D.”) Suppose that Alphie is the animal satisfying that description. In that case, Alphie is the thing referred to by that expression. But “the first animal born in the year 3000 A.D.” refers to Alphie by virtue of encoding descriptive information that singles out Alphie; that expression does not refer to him by virtue of there being some causal relation between tokens of it and states of affairs involving Alphie. Such a causal connection doesn’t exist. Even if it did, it wouldn’t be what is operative. This point can be generalized. (CTR) is not meant to apply to any expression that has constituent structure. “That snow is white” refers to the proposition that snow is white. The former refers to the latter because the latter is the thing having the properties in the descriptive content encoded in the former. CTR may be meant to apply to the constituents of “that snow is white”, but not to that expression as a whole. So far we’ve spoken about what CTR does not say. To explain what CTR does say, we need to define a few terms. Let R be a referring term belonging to some language L. R is “rigid” iff it refers to the same thing in every world where L is spoken. In every world where English is spoken, “Richard Nixon” refers to Richard Nixon. Of course, there might be a world where “Richard Nixon” refers to John Kerry, but where otherwise English is spoken just as it is here. But, strictly speaking, the language spoken there isn’t quite identical with the language spoken here; that version of English comprises the rule:",

(CTR) is meant, presumably, to apply to de jure rigid designators, like “Nixon” and “Socrates”. It is not meant to apply to de facto rigid designators like “the number of primes between 10 and 20”. De facto rigid designators refer by virtue of encoding the right descriptive information, never merely by virtue of a causal connection. Even with all of these restrictions, problems arise for (CTR). That doctrine has a hard time dealing with expressions that are de jure rigid designators, such as “2” and “justice”. These terms denote abstract objects. Nothing has any causal connection to such an object. So it isn’t clear how CTR can deal with such terms. I myself think that the causal theory is wrong even for “Nixon” and “Socrates”. But this is neither here nor there. What I wish to show now is that even if (CTR) is unrestrictedly true, there is still no opposition between it and (SC).

For the sake of argument, suppose that the causal theorist is right; suppose there is some causal relation R such that x (a given sound or inscription) refers to y iff y stands in R to x. In that case, tokens of “Socrates” refer to Socrates because Socrates stands in relation R to those tokens. But it is easy to show a causal relation is never sufficient for reference. And when we make it clear what is sufficient, it turns out that a causal connection between object and token has a decidedly subordinate role. Obviously there is an Albanian word for Socrates, a Finnish word for Socrates, an Urdu word for Socrates, and so on. These are different words. According to the causal theorist, for any token t of any one of these words, what makes t refer to Socrates is that Socrates stands in R to t. The Urdu word for Socrates is “Sukrat”. So according to the causal theorist, tokens of “Sukrat” refer to Socrates because Socrates stands in R to “Sukrat”. The same is true mutatis mutandis of the Albanian word for Socrates, the Finnish word, the Hungarian word, and so on. Let us focus on “Sukrat”. If you were to put “Sukrat” in an English sentence (I mean, if you were to use N in an English sentence, not mention it), the result would be ungrammatical; you would not have a well-formed sentence of English.

Such terms refer by virtue of describing, not by virtue of a casual connection.

These problems vanish when CTR is put in its proper context. In some cases, we define a word by pointing to its referent: “that man over there is Thaddeus Smith.” Reference is secured through ostension. This is not always how words are defined. When we leave aside ostensive definition, we find that reference is always secured in the same way. We describe the thing to which an expression is meant to apply.

Once this is realized, we don’t have to invent tortured hypotheses as to why there really is a causal connection between the number two and tokens of the expression “2”. There is no such connection; such tokens are not causally connected to the platonic type two, but only to its instances. Even if there were such a causal connection, it wouldn’t be reference-constituting.

In my view, it is analytic that “Sukrat” can refer to Socrates only in Urdu. Given any word w of any language L, it is analytic that w cannot be used grammatically in a sentence not belonging to L. A homonym of w can be so used, but not w itself. Perhaps a homonym of “Sukrat” refers to Socrates in some language other than Urdu. In that case, that homonym can be used grammatically in some language other than Urdu. But the Urdu word “Sukrat” cannot refer to Socrates, or have any grammatically licensed role, in any language other than Urdu. Suppose the gases brewing in a volcano yield the noise “Socrates was wise”. The volcano hasn’t really said anything. It produced sounds that would have meant something if we had produced them. When we say “Socrates was wise”, it is in consequence of our following certain semantic rules. If we were following no such rules, then we wouldn’t be using a language at all; we wouldn’t be saying anything. By exactly similar reasoning, what makes a sound be a token of a word is that one produces that token in consequence of one’s following a certain semantic rule; if one is just caused to blurt it out – the way a corpse might be electrically stimulated to make noise – one wouldn’t really have produced a bit of language at all. Unless we have something that is a consequence of one’s awareness of a semantic rule, we don’t have a word-token. A corollary is that which word you are tokening is not determined solely by the phonetic properties of your utterance. If you really produced a word-token, and not just a noise that sounds like a word-token, that means you were following a semantic rule, and that you produced that word-token as a consequence thereof. Which word you tokened is a function of which rule you were following. As we said before, a word never refers simpliciter; it always refers in this or that particular language.

So what is learned in the one case is very different from what is learned in the other. There are obviously elements of deep truth in Frege’s position. But there are also deep muddles. To see the truth in Frege’s position, we must first identify the muddles. First, there is no such thing as the expression “the inventor of bifocals” or the sentence “the inventor of bifocals snored”. There are expression-types and expression-tokens. Type-meaning is different from token meaning. The meaning of an expression-type is a rule saying how to compute the meanings of the corresponding tokens. The meaning of the type corresponding to (i) is a rule saying which propositions are meant by tokens of that type. The meaning of one of those tokens is the proposition assigned it by that rule. The meaning of the type “the inventor of bifocals” is a rule saying what its tokens refer to. The meaning of a given token is the thing referred to. The rule that assigns propositions to tokens of (i) is very different from the rule that assigns propositions to tokens of (ii).

Frege held that proper names have both sense and reference: he didn’t confine himself to definite descriptions. Where definite descriptions are concerned, sense is indeed type-semantics, as Kaplan says. But where proper names are concern, sense is not type-semantics: it is rather the information through which one grasps type-semantics. Frege thought that, at the level of literal meaning, proper names (“Hesperus” and “Socrates”) are really definite descriptions (“the last celestial body to disappear from the morning sky”, “the great philosopher who died of hemlock-poisoning”). Saul Kripke (1972, 1979) refuted this: proper names have no sense – they are just labels. (Attempts have to re-descriptivize names. But Soames (2001, 2005) did a good job of shutting down these attempts.) But Kripke’s important semantic points leave a major question unanswered. In fact, they don’t deal with any of the data that led Frege to regard names as descriptions. Suppose “Hesperus” and “Phosphorous” are mere labels.

So to understand the utterance in question of “the man who stole my wallet is not a person of high morality” is to know how to assign it the right proposition, not which proposition it encodes. This applies, in particular, to the definite description. To understand it is not to know which thing it refers to; it is to know how to “hook it up” to the right thing by manipulating the relevant semantic rules. So a more refined conception of linguistic understanding bears out the intuition – whose correctness we denied – that one can understand a token of *the phi has psi* without knowing who the phi is. Here is what I say to this. I agree that true understanding involves knowledge of the right “derivation tree”. But knowledge of the right derivation-tree relates to understanding the relevant type. (KDT) is true of type-understanding. (KP) is true of token-understanding. There is the proposition meant by (*). And then there is a proposition saying how to compute the proposition meant by (*). The latter is the proposition that gives the “derivation tree” for (*). Consider the sentence-type corresponding to (*). To know the meaning of that sentence-type is to know how to compute, or derive, the meanings of its tokens. So knowledge of derivation-trees is type-knowledge. To know the meaning of the token is to know which proposition lies at the end of the derivation tree. Let us sum up. There is indeed a sense in which Smith does not understand (*).

But consideration of the character-content distinction is not enough: we had to take into account the descriptive nature of sense-perception; we have to be very careful in our description of what it was, exactly, that was seen. This helps solve a problem that Kaplan himself identified for his own theory. In the late morning, you point up at the sky, at the last celestial body to remain visible. You say “that” very slowly. After a few hours, you say “is identical with”. Then, the moment a celestial body becomes visible in the evening sky, you say “that”. So you have said “that is that”, though very slowly. The referent of the first “that’ is identical with the referent of the alter. So, if Kaplan’s theory is right, then that utterance encodes a trivial proposition, one of the form: O is identical with O. (In fact, it encodes the proposition Venus=Venus.) But obviously what was communicated was not trivial at all. How do we deal with this? The character-content distinction isn’t much help, since the same character, and the same content, is involved in both cases. Here we need to apply the same method as before. Consider the first utterance of “that”. What was the visual perception you had in connection with that utterance? You weren’t just seeing Venus. You were seeing a celestial body that alone occupied the late morning sky. (Of course, you were seeing much more than this: imagine all the data that go into a visual perception: the specificity of it – all the spatial and chromatic content.) So what was pointed out was not just Venus; what was pointed out would be given (partially, though not completely) by the expression “occupant of the late morning sky”, or some such. And, for exactly similar reasons, the perception you had in connection with your second utterance of “that” was not (just) Venus; what was pointed out would be given (partially, though not completely) by the expression “sole occupant of the early evening sky”, or some such.

The distinction between “sense” and “reference” is close to, if not identical with, the distinction between “intension” and “extension”. The sense of “the inventor of bifocals” is the concept (or property) unique inventor of bifocals. The referent is the thing to which that concept applies (or which has the property). The sense-reference distinction applies to singular terms. The intension-extension distinction is the corresponding distinction for plural terms. Consider the expression “rhenates”. The intension is the concept thing with a kidney (or, perhaps, the property of having a kidney). The extension is the class of things having kidneys. The intension of “rhenate” is different from the intension of “chordate”. But they have the same extension. We found that, where definite descriptions are concerned, “sense” is type-semantics and “reference” is token semantics. There is no one entity that has both sense and reference. The type has sense. The token has reference. Where plural referring terms are concerned, an exactly similar thing is true of intension and extension. There is no one expression that has both intension and extension. The type has intension. The token has extension. It would be incoherent to say that some one expression has both intension and extension: that position leads to a contradiction. Let us start with a more straightforward case of an expression that is alleged to have both extension and intension. The word “whale”, we are told, has both intension and extension. The intension is a property or function (from objects to truth-values). The extension is the class of whales (Shamu, Willy, Moby Dick…) We don’t want to say that the expression-type “whale” denotes different classes in different worlds, while having the same semantics. That is perilously close to absurdity. The extension of a term is the set of objects that it refers to. So unless we divorce reference from semantic content, it is self-contradictory to say that “whale” has the same semantics in worlds where it has different extensions. What we must say is: tokens of “whales” denote different classes in different worlds; the type has an invariant meaning: it pairs off a token of “whale” in a world W with a class C iff C is the class containing all and only whales in W. The type “whale” has an intension....",

I myself think that, in some cases, tokens of “rhenates” do function as quantifiers. Supose you say “rhenates are necessarily chordates”. There is no set of individuals A1…An such that you are saying: A1…An are necessarily chordates (even though it is probably true that they are necessarily chordates). You are saying: necessarily, for any x, if x is a chordate, then x is a rhenate. So I think that, in some cases, tokens of “whales”, “rhenates”, and the like, are possibly quantifiers. Let us sum up. (*) is a reasonable view. If we accept (*), then it becomes contradictory to say that “whale” can vary in extension (referent, basically) while keeping the same semantics. At the same time, it is clear that “whale” has both intension and extension; and that both are essential. We accommodate all of this by distinguishing types from tokens. The type has intension (a function from worlds to sets); the tokens have extension (the just mentioned sets). Nothing is required to have the same semantics while having different referents. So there is no contradiction; and there is no need to avoid contradiction by adopting the desperate view that the referent of a referring term is irrelevant to its semantics. The data relating to cognitive significance are easily explained: we need only take into account the differences in type -semantics relating to (say) “rhenates” and “chordates”, along with the fact that token-meaning is always grasped by way of knowledge of type-semantics.",

    "text": "§ Carnap (1947) said that the intension of a “sentence” (he didn’t distinguish tokens from types) is a proposition, and that the extension of a sentence is a truth-value. This view is generally seen as either true or, if not quite true, then very reasonable: a reasonable extension of the term “extension”. Carnap’s view, I am afraid, doesn’t deserve quite such a warm response. We found that the intension of “whale” is a property of the corresponding type, and that the extension is a property of tokens (in a given world). Types have intention; tokens have extension. By parity of reasoning, sentence-types have intension; sentence-tokens have extension. The intension of a sentence is some kind of function. But it cannot be a function from worlds to truth-values, for the reasons we’ve seen. The type “I am tired’ does not bear any proposition; so it cannot have a proposition for its intension. The same must be true of the type “Socrates was wise”. If we assign a different kind of intension to the type “Socrates was wise”, we end up committed to the highly arbitrary view that sentences can have entirely different sorts of things for the intensions: some have propositions (functions from worlds to truth-values), while others have functions from contexts of utterance to truth-values. In so far as the type “I am tired” has a meaning, it is a function from contexts of utterance to propositions. So if anything is its intension, it is that function. If anything is the intension of “Socrates was wise”, it is a function from contexts (worlds, times – there may be other parameters) of utterance to propositions. The extension of a token of “I am tired” must be the thing that the intension of the corresponding type assigns to that token – just as the extension of a token of “whale” is the thing that the intension of the corresponding type assigns to that token. So the extension of a token of “I am tired” is the meaning of that token. Thus, the extension of a token of “Socrates was wise” is the thing it means (roughly, the proposition that Socrates was wise); it is not, pace Carnap, a truth-value. A proposition can be seen as a function from worlds to truth-values. So, at least arguably, the extension of Socrates is wise is the truth-value true in worlds where he is wise, and...",

A concept of Socrates is some concept C such that Socrates falls under C. x is a greatest teacher of Plato is a concept of Socrates because Socrates falls under that concept. Given that Socrates falls under that concept, we can say that it assigns truth to Socrates. A concept is a function from objects to truth-values. x is a greatest teacher of Plato is not a concept of the truth-value that it assigns to Socrates; it is a concept of Socrates. If a proposition is a concept, it is a function that assigns truth-values to objects. If a proposition is such a function, the objects in question are worlds. Indeed, propositions are often analyzed as functions that assigns truth-values to worlds. Let w be this world. The proposition Socrates was wise assigns truth to w. Just as x is a greatest teacher of Plato is a concept of Socrates, not of the truth-value that it assigns to Socrates, so Socrates was wise is a concept of w, not of the truth-value that it assigns to w. Propositions are concepts of worlds, not of truth-values. When we make it clear what concepts are – functions from entities to truth-values – it is no longer tenable to say that the semantic contribution of a sentence-token is a truth-value. § This brings us to one other reason to say that sentence-tokens refer to their meanings, not their truth-values. I don’t think this reason is conclusive. But it is suggestive. The content of the type “inventor of bifocals” is a rule that assigns a referent to its tokens. The content of a given token is the referent. The same is true of “Plato”. The only difference is that semantic content of the type “Plato” is a constant function, whereas that associated with “the inventor of bifocals” is a variable function. In some world, tokens of “the inventor of bifocals” refer to Jefferson. In all worlds, tokens of “Plato” refer to Plato. (We are talking about worlds semantically identical with ours.) So when we look at singular terms, we find that sense (intension) is identical with type meaning and referent (extension) is identical with token meaning.

Sentence-types encode, not propositions, but functions that assign propositions to sentence-tokens.

If Russell’s theory is right, then CR cannot be used to generate the needed transitions. Obviously not all sentences have the same meaning. So Russell’s theory must be right. There are two major problems with Gödel’s argument. First, that argument relies heavily on the idea that logically equivalent sentences co-refer. This assumption is unwarranted – it appears warranted only when S-equivalence and L-equivalence are conflated -- and it is probably false. So Gödel’s argument fails. Let us discuss the second problem with Gödel’s theory. This one is identified by Barwise and Perry (1983). Tokens of definite descriptions are either quantifiers or they are terms that refer to individuals. Let us consider each case. First let us suppose that tokens of definite descriptions refer to individuals. Remember what we established earlier: if two terms co-refer, they make exactly the same semantic contribution. The following two expressions co-refer:",

So even if logically equivalent sentences did co-refer, (1) and (2) would not co-refer. For the same reason, neither would (6) and (7). So the argument is a failure if definite descriptions refer to individuals. It is a failure if they don’t refer to individuals. If they don’t refer to individuals, they are quantifiers. If they are quantifiers, then either they don’t refer to anything or they refer to functions. If they don’t refer to anything, then (CR) no longer permits the steps from (2) to (3) or from (5) to (6). If definite descriptions refer to functions, then CR still cannot be used to make those steps. If they refer to functions, then “the unique thing x such that [Fx and x=a]” refers to a very different function from “the unique thing x such that [a is not b and x=a].” There are possible worlds (this is not one of them) where English is spoken where those functions assign different truth-values to the same entity. On any reading of definite descriptions, Gödel’s argument fails. There is yet another reason why Gödel’s argument fails. Replace each occurrence of “the” in that argument with “ze”, as defined earlier. Let GödelZ be the resulting argument. GödelZ is an exact analogue of Gödel’s original argument. Nothing can prove that “ze phi” is not a referring term; for, by our stipulation, it is just that. But if GödelZ is cogent, then it “proves” that “ze phi” doesn’t refer. If GödelZ is cogent, it isn’t cogent; therefore it isn’t cogent. Therefore, the same is true of Gödel’s original argument.",

A correct semantics must account for these differences among (i)-(iv). We’ve identified reference with semantic contribution. What an expression-token refers to is nothing other than what it semantically contributes to sentences in which it occurs. Tokens of (i) are assertions; they have indicative force. Tokens of (ii) are commands; they have imperative force. Tokens of (iii) are questions; they have interrogative force. Tokens of (iv) that Plato snores don’t have any of these properties. So tokens of (i)-(iv) all contribute different things. If our analysis of reference is correct, they cannot all refer to the same thing. At the same time, there is not the slightest doubt that at least part of what is semantically contributed by tokens of (i)-(iv) is the proposition: that Plato snores. So part of what they refer to is that proposition. Here is how I propose to make sense of all this. Part of what tokens of (i)-(iv) refer to is the proposition: that Plato snores. The reason is that all those tokens actually contain the expression: “that Plato snores”. (i)-(iii) contain it in a phonetically disguised form. Suppose somebody asks you “who was the greatest philosopher of antiquity?”, and you say “Socrates”. Your answer contains a phonetically disguised: “was the greatest philosopher of antiquity.” Similarly, (i)-(iii) contain a phonetically distorted “that Plato snores”. But (i)-(iii) do not just contain that expression. They contain extra semantic material. In each case, that material denotes a function. That function is what gives indicative force to tokens of (i), imperative force to tokens of (ii), and so on. We will work out the details shortly. A correct semantics must do justice to the fact that “Plato snores”, “does Plato snore?”, and “Plato, snore!” are all members of the same basic semantic category. They are all sentences. There are important differences between them. This puts them in different sub-categories. But there is some one non-disjunctive category that comprises all and only those things we call “sentences”. A correct semantics must find the property had by all and only the things in that category. A sentence-token, I will argue, is an expression that denotes a very special kind of function.

A token of an imperative denotes a function that assigns the property of success to that same token exactly if the addressee makes a certain proposition be true. If I say: “march!”, my words are really elliptical for: “you: march!”. So if O is the addressee, then the proposition encoded in my utterance is: that O marches. The “you” is semantically present, but phonetically unrealized. To make things as clear as possible, I will always include the name of the person addressed. So I will not talk about utterances of “march!”, but about utterances of “Plato, march!”, “Socrates, march!”, and so on. Suppose I am talking to Plato, and I say: “Plato, march!”. Let t be that token. Everyone who speaks English knows that, at the level of semantics, t is a success if it is obeyed and is a failure otherwise. Everyone who speaks English knows which proposition the addressee must make true if he is to obey that imperative. That proposition, of course, is: that Plato marches. Again, we must distinguish semantic success and failure from other kinds. Many kinds of success can be achieved by uttering an unobeyed imperative: one can amuse, intimidate, manipulate, provoke, help, inform. And many kinds of failure can be incurred through issuing obeyed commands. But semantically an utterance of an imperative is a success exactly if it is obeyed. At some level, everybody who speaks a language knows that. So, at the level of semantics, t is a success exactly if the addressee obeys it – exactly if, in response to my utterance, Plato makes true the proposition that Plato marches. Thus, the semantic content of t assigns success to t exactly if, in response to t, the addressee makes true the proposition: that Plato marches. So that semantic content is a function that assigns the property of success to that token exactly if, in response to that utterance, the addressee makes true that proposition. One point should be clarified. Suppose I use an imperative to command somebody to do such and such.

Yes-no questions always encode a complete proposition. A token of “does Plato snore?” encodes the proposition: that Plato snores. Ordinary questions encode propositional functions: proposition-like entities that contain a free variable. “Where did Smith go?” encodes the propositional function: That Smith went to__ There is a blank or free-variable. No complete proposition is encoded. Let us start with yes-no questions. At the level of semantics, a question is a success only if it is answered correctly.

It is obvious how to apply this analysis to an ordinary question, like “what did Plato eat?” Given any sentence-token s, there is some proposition P such that s is a success exactly if P holds. So the semantic content of a sentence-token is a function that assigns it success exactly if some proposition holds. The semantic content of a sentence-type is a function that pairs its tokens off with functions like the one just described. Of course, a thing does not just have semantic content; it has semantic content relative to the rules of this or that language. Thus, a thing e qualifies as a sentence-token only if, for some language L, the semantic rules of L assign a function F to e such that, for some proposition P, F assigns the property of success to e exactly if P is true. A thing E qualifies as a sentence-type only if it pairs off its tokens with functions like the one just described. For reasons we have just seen, if a thing e is to qualify as a sentence-token, it is necessary that, as a matter of semantics, there be some proposition P such that e’s success turn on whether P is true.

One reason for this, I feel, is that (indicative) sentence-tokens are true or false, while paradigmatic referring terms are not. “Plato” is not true or false. Expressions referring to propositions – for example, “that Plato snores” – are not true or false, even though the things they denote are true or false. Sentence-tokens are true or false; paradigm cases of referring terms are neither. It follows, we are told, that sentence-tokens don’t refer. This argument is confused; it involves an erroneous conception of reference. It involves the erroneous idea that reference is severable from semantic contribution. But that argument points to a desideratum that any correct semantics for sentences must satisfy. We observed that a certain circularity characterizes my analysis of sentence-tokens and sentence–types. Any analysis that satisfies the desideratum just mentioned will be characterized by a similar circularity. Some say that sentences refer to truth-values.

Granted, (s*) and (s) almost have the same semantics. They both semantically encode that snow is white; and neither semantically encodes any other proposition. So it is largely right to say that (s) and (s*) refer to the same thing. But it isn’t quite right. Any theory that purports to give the semantics of indicative sentence-tokens must explain why such tokens are true or false. If we say that sentence-tokens have such and such semantic content, it is absolutely crucial that no expression having such and such content can lack assertoric force. The existing theories – sentence-tokens refer to truth-values, sentence-tokens refer to propositions -- miserably fail this test. Barwise and Perry say that the semantic content of a sentence-token is a “situation” or a “class of situations.” But this cannot be right. Let C be any situation, or class of situations, you please. We can produce an expression that is not a sentence-token, and whose referent, and whose sole semantic content, is C. Let “SC” be a name for C. “SC” isn’t any more true or false than “Caesar”. Most expressions referring to functions are not true or false. This fact is especially important. For it is tempting to analyze sentence-tokens as follows. The semantic content of a sentence-token is a function that assigns truth to that sentence-token exactly if a certain proposition is true. So the semantic content of (s) is some function F that assigns the property of truth to (s) exactly if that snow is white is true. The problem is: we can easily produce an expression whose sole semantic content is F, and that isn’t true or false. Here is an example. Let “F” be an expression whose sole semantic content is F. “F” is not true or false; it is no more a sentence than “Caesar”. So the semantic content of “snow is white” cannot be F, at least not F alone. Nothing that lacks assertoric force can have the same semantic content as (s), or any other sentence-token.

There are very good reasons for thinking that “the teacher of Aristotle” is not semantically ambiguous, and that its amenability to both referential and attributive readings is a matter of pragmatics, not semantics. The objector seems to be saying that “grass is green” is, in this respect, like a definite description. In (3) it refers to a truth-value (it refers to it by encoding descriptive information that singles it out). So in that context it is functioning “referentially”. But in (4), “grass is green” refers to a proposition. So it is functioning “attributively”. But even though “grass is green” may function in both ways, it doesn’t follow that it is semantically ambiguous. The ambiguity might be completely pragmatic, like that of “the teacher of Aristotle”. So maybe, at the level of semantics, “grass is green” always refers to a truth-value. That it sometimes seems not to do so is some kind of pragmatic epiphenomenon.

The expression “grass is green” per se wouldn’t refer to anything; its semantic content would be a function of a certain kind. A consequence is that the semantic content of a token of “grass is green” is a truth-value, while the semantic content of the expression-type is the just mentioned function. Now we can see the problem with the objector’s approach. If he is right, then one cannot know the semantic content of a token of “grass is green” unless one knows its truth-value in the context (world) of utterance (just as one cannot know the semantic content of an indexical unless one knows what it refers to in the context of utterance). In general, one cannot know the semantic content of a token of a sentence unless one knows its truth-value in the context (world) of utterance But it is hard to believe that I don’t know the semantic content of a token of a sentence-token if I don’t know its truth-value. To understand a sentence-token – to understand a token of “that person is tired” – is to know what would have to be the case if it were true; it is not to know whether it is true. The most natural position, I think, is to say that one can understand sentence-tokens without knowing their truth-values; and, consequently, that such tokens do not refer to truth-values. As we’ve seen, it is not easy to make the case that sentence-types refer to truth-values. For obviously the truth-value associated with the sentence-type “grass is green” varies from world to world, and possibly even from time to time, even though its semantics does not thus vary.

Very roughly, what is happening is this. (i) comprises phonetically unrealized material that ascribes truth to that proposition. Consequently, (i) is true just in case “that Plato snores” denotes a true proposition. (ii) comprises material that ascribes the property of being believed by Fred to that proposition. Consequently, (ii) is true just in case that proposition has that property. (iii) comprises material that ascribes the property of being possibly true to that proposition.

The English word “Socrates” can be tokened by physical entities that have absolutely nothing in common. First of all, that word can be spoken or written or expressed by hand-signals. No hand-signal has any physical similarity to any spoken token or any written token. No written token has any similarity to any spoken token. Further, given any two written tokens of “Socrates”, they may bear minimal resemblance to each other. If a court-reporter tokens that word in his short-hand, the result will bear little, if any, resemblance to what I write if I type it or if I write it in cursive. If a person with damaged vocal chords tokens that word, the result bears no resemblance to what results when I token it.

No. It would have produced sounds that, had we produced them, would have qualified as speech. The machine hasn’t spoken at all; it hasn’t said anything. It made sounds, but it was not using those sounds to execute some linguistic intention. So it didn’t produce word-tokens. It produced sounds that, had we produced them, would have been words. Where the right psychological background is lacking, there are no word-tokens. But the right psychological background is not enough. First of all, one never just speaks or writes; one always speaks or writes in this or that language. Now suppose I think that, in English, “blrak blurg gralb” means grass is green; and I say “blrak blur gralb” with the intention of saying grass is green. Because there is no existing practice of taking “grass is green” to mean grass is green, I haven’t said anything, at least not in English. And I haven’t said anything in any other language. As we saw earlier, when discussing “Sukrat”, if a noise that I produce is to qualify as a token of a word of some language L, then that noise must be a consequence of my believing that in L that noise has a certain meaning. My utterance of “blrak blur gralb” was a consequence of my belief that in English that noise means grass is green; it was not a consequence of any beliefs about L. So I didn’t say anything in any language. What makes a physical event be a tokening of this or that expression is not that it has these or those phonetic properties. It is that the event is caused by certain psychological events, in a certain cultural or historical context. The phonetic or geometrical properties of that event help others to identify the presence of the psychological and cultural factors that allow for the tokening of expressions.

You cannot understand all of these sentences. But that has nothing to do with your semantic knowledge. It has to do with your ability to exploit your semantic knowledge. It has to do with matters relating to fatigue, limitations of memory, and general cognitive ability.

Let “snow is white1” be synonymous with the sentence “snow is white” when it occurs on its own, or in an otherwise truth-functional context. Let “snow is white2” be synonymous with “snow is white” when the latter occurs in the scope of a single epistemic operator.

After all, English semantics does comprise infinitely many rules. But most of them are derived; and one can learn those on the basis of the primitive rules.

This supposition is false. But without it, Frege’s argument fails. So let us grant it. There is “no backwards road” from denotation to sense, Russell once said. Any given thing can be given by infinitely many different senses. After all, any thing can be uniquely singled out by infinitely many different descriptions. So, for each i, there are infinitely many possible senses that “snowi ” could have. The recursive rule just described would have to choose some one sense. Any such choice would obviously be arbitrary; it wouldn’t correspond to any fact about the actual semantics of “snow”. Further, the semantic rule described would have to select a single member from each one of an infinitely large number of infinitely large classes. It is, to my knowledge, an open question in set theory whether such a rule could exist. I conclude that Davidson’s argument has some force, and that attempts to meet it redound to the discredit of Frege’s theory. For reasons discussed earlier, Frege’s view is not an anachronism. If we say that sentences refer to truth-values, then we must probably adopt Frege’s view. We must say that “snow” is infinitely ambiguous, and that each of its disambiguations is given meaning by a primitive semantic rule. So, if we say that sentences refer to truth-values, we are saying, by implication, that English comprises infinitely many primitive semantic rules.",

Among such phrases are different kinds of existential quantifiers: “something”, “some man”, “three birds”. According to Russell, definite descriptions are existential quantifiers. Frege has given us a very plausible analysis of such expressions. But a commonly accepted analysis of them actually makes Frege’s analysis be wrong; more exactly, it makes Frege’s analysis be only partially correct.

If that is right, then in some cases what is wanted is a thing – a vase, a sloop, a car -- whereas in other cases what is wanted is that a certain proposition be true: one involving a vase, a sloop, a car. So on Quine’s analysis, “wants” is ambiguous between “wantsT” and “wantsP”. The former takes objects for its complements; the latter takes propositions. The latter denotes a propositional attitude; the former does not – it denotes an “objectual attitude”. I doubt that “wants” is ambiguous, semantically or even just pragmatically, between “wantsT” and “wantsP”. I am pretty sure that the kind of thing “wants” denotes in (iW) is identical with the thing it denotes in (iN). I am pretty sure that “wants” always denotes a propositional attitude. Also, even if we leave aside matters of semantics, I really doubt that the very concept of desire is thus disjunctive: I doubt that there is one kind of wanting that concerns states of affairs and another that concerns objects. I may “want” a particular sloop; I may “want” some sloop or other, not this or that specific sloop; but what varies is not the nature of wanting, but the identity of the thing I want. Here is what I would propose. In every case, the object of “wants” is a proposition. When we say that so and so and “wants” x, we are really saying that so and so wants some proposition to be true concerning so and so’s relation to x. If I say: “Smith wants a car”, I am saying: Smith wants it to be the case that: Smith has a car. The story is not relevantly different if there is some specific car that Smith wants. Suppose we say: “ there is some particular car x such that Smith wants x.” What we are saying is: “ there is some particular car x such that Smith wants that: Smith has x.” So Quine’s narrow-scope reading of (i) is quite correct.

First, if you say that John “wants” anything, you are always attributing a propositional attitude to him, even if we give a de re reading to the statement in question. Suppose John wants some specific sloop – say, The Winds of War. What John wants is that a certain proposition be true, namely: the proposition that John owns The Winds of War. Even if you want some specific woman – Sally, say -- to be your bride, you still have an attitude towards a proposition; you want the proposition that Sally is my bride to be true. You don’t just want: Sally. In general, even when it is a specific thing that one wants, one has a propositional, not an objectual, attitude. That by itself shows that Quine’s analysis is wrong.

So if t is a token of “for some x”, then the semantic content of t is a function F that assigns truth to a class C exactly if C is instantiated. Let T be the type corresponding to t. The semantic content of t is a function that assigns F to t. Exactly similar remarks apply to “some” and (mutatis mutandis) to “some man”, “something”, and so on. It is pretty clear how this analysis generalizes to other quantifiers. If t is a token of “nothing” (“everything”, “most things”, “many things”), then t denotes a function F that assigns truth to a class C exactly if C is uninstantiated (universally instantiated, usually instantiated, instantiated to a non-negligible degree). The semantic content of T, the corresponding type, is a function that assigns F to t.

Semantics has to respect grammar, at least up to a point. Grammatical categories may be useless when it comes to logic or metaphysics. But they cannot be useless when it comes to semantics. How could they be?

So it is a truism that semantics, at least the semantics of natural language, must respect grammar. We don’t want to say that (tokens of) some noun-phrases denote second-level functions, while others denote individuals. That, it seems to me, would make “Plato” fall into a very different grammatical category from “some man” and “that man”. This last point, I grant, is not exactly air-tight.

In what does the “unity of the proposition” lie? This question has never been adequately answered. I believe that our analysis of propositions gives us an answer to this question. § Frege’s answer was to say that, in a proposition, certain items are “unsaturated”: they have holes in them. These holes enable the items in the proposition to link together in the right way. In (A), the expression “punches” corresponds to something with holes in it; these holes enable Smith and Jones to link up with that thing in the appropriate way. By contrast, in (B), the thing corresponding to “the relation of punching” doesn’t have the right number of holes in it; so it doesn’t appropriately link up with Bob and Smith. Frege’s “solution” is really just a way of labeling the problem, as Davidson said. Obviously we aren’t talking about physical holes. We are talking about holes in a metaphorical sense. What we want to know – what Frege doesn’t tell us – is what this metaphor is a metaphor for. The difference between (A) and (B) obviously has something to do with the fact that the first has grammar, whereas the second does not. In the first, there are inflections. (I will argue later some of these are not phonetically apparent.) In the second, nothing is inflected. The difference between a proposition and a non-propositional heap is somehow coded in these grammatical articulations. The question is: what exactly these articulations do? Do they themselves refer to entities of some kind? Does the “-s” on “punches” refer to some mysterious entity – perhaps to kind of function? Is that why (A) encodes a proposition while (B) does not? Are grammatical articulations referring terms with the special property that the things to which they refer confer unity on what would otherwise an unordered heap?

The ordinal properties of this set can be coded in, and actually identified with, the properties of some unordered set, namely ((2), (2,3)). I will argue that propositions are unordered sets of properties. Thus Smith punches Jones is a set of properties. For a proposition to be true is specifically for all of its constituents to be instantiated. Truth is instantiation. For a proposition to be true is for all the members of a certain kind of set to be instantiated. Here two worries immediately arise. First, it seems obvious that Smith punches Jones and Jones punches Smith have the same constituents, even though they are obviously different propositions. I will argue that those two propositions share constituents – they have in common Jones, Smith, and the relation of punching. But the one proposition has constituents not had by the others; and the ordinal differences between those two propositions are reflected in these differences in their constituents. The other worry is this: Surely Smith is not a property; surely Smith cannot be instantiated. Let me outline what I will say about this. On my analysis, (Ap) is identical with some set S that comprises only things that can be instantiated, and that therefore comprises only properties. I will argue that what is a member of S is not Smith per se but is rather the property of being identical with Smith. Obviously that thing can be instantiated. No doubt, this maneuver will raise another concern: a concern I will spend a lot of time trying to allay. It will at once be said that what is a constituent of (Ap) is Smith and not the property of being identical with Smith. (Ap) says that Smith punched Jones, not that the property of being identical with Smith did so. I fully agree: what is a constituent of (Ap) is Smith, and Smith – nothing else – is what punched Jones. But we need to be very clear what it means to say that something is a constituent of a proposition.

For Smith to be a constituent of (Ap) is specifically for (Ap) to be about Smith -- it is for there to be a dependence relation between Smith and (Ap). Precisely that dependence-relation holds between Smith and (Ap) if we identify (Ap) with S, and then go on the truth of (Ap) with the being-instantiated of all the members of S. So our analysis is consistent with the truth of statement that Smith is “constituent” or “part” (Ap), at least on any significant disambiguation of that statement. It is irrelevant that Smith himself is not a member of S. When we are talking about the membership of S we are talking about one thing; when are talking about the constituency of P we are talking about another (we are taking about relations of dependency or aboutness). There is a connection between these two sets of facts: facts about the constituency of P – facts about the aboutness relations in question – are realized by or supervene on facts about the membership of S. But, strictly speaking, the two sets of facts are distinct. We will explore this further in due course. § There is yet another worry. Some may object to the idea that there is such a thing as the property of being identical with Smith. It will be said that tallness is a property, and so is wetness – but there is no such thing as the property of being identical with Smith. I think this point of view is wrong for two different reasons. First, statements like “so and so is not identical with Smith” are obviously meaningful – indeed, they are often true -- and it is hard to see how this could be the case unless there were such a thing as being identical with Smith. Second, suppose that Smith exists in some world w. Obviously Smith is not a basic constituent of w; he is not one of its lower level constituents – he is not a quark or a muon or a single displacement of mass-energy.

If reality comprises a state of affairs in which those things are arranged in that way, then the sentence is true. If not, it is false. Suppose this view is right. In that case, the proposition that Smith punches Jones consists of Smith, Jones, and the relation of punching being arranged in a certain way; and they are arranged in the very way in which they would be arranged in the corresponding state of affairs. The sentence is isomorphic with the proposition. The proposition is isomorphic with state of affairs. That is why the sentence represents the state of affairs. There is an obvious problem with this. If this view is right, then the thing meant by “Smith punches Jones” consists of Smith, Jones, and the relation of punching being arranged in the very way they are arranged in the corresponding state of affairs. How are they arranged in that state of affairs? Smith is punching Jones. So if the view in question is right, the proposition that Smith punches Jones consists of Smith standing in the relation of punching with respect to Jones. But this means that the mere existence of the proposition guarantees its truth.

But the proposition Smith punches Jones exists regardless of whether Smith punches Jones.

First, propositions are true or false. But a state of affairs is not true or false, and therefore isn’t a proposition. Second, (i) makes it impossible for there to be false propositions, unless one takes the heroic of measure of saying that there exist non-existent states of affairs. Some (e.g. Barwise and Perry) have identified propositions with possible states of affairs or, at any rate, with sets of such things. This is not so different from position (iii). Before we consider (iii), we should note one other reason why propositions cannot be states of affairs: this other reason is crucial to having a correct conception of what propositions are; it is also crucial to evaluating the Barwise-Perry position. Consider (Ap). That proposition has a unique decomposition into minimal parts. It neatly decomposes into Smith, the relation of punching, and Jones. (It may have other ingredients, corresponding to tense-markers and the like. Let us ignore these for now.) Notice that, in that proposition, the relation of punching is completely distinct from Jones and from Smith. The proposition connects them, of course. But each of these things occurs in its purity: what occurs is not Jones’ being tall or angry, but simply Jones. The proposition consists of three, neatly separated (though linked) entities. In light of this, suppose that (Ap) is true. Consider the state of affairs that makes it true – imagine Smith punching Jones. Let S be that state of affairs. S doesn’t have a structure even remotely like that of (Ap). S’s minimal parts are definitely not the relation of punching, Smith, or Jones. First of all, Smith’s act of punching is “adjectival” on Smith. It isn’t as though Smith is here, and his act of punching is there. Smith’s punching Jones is inseparable from Smith and Jones. Further, that act is by no means a minimal part of the states of affairs involved. It probably involved a number of subsidiary acts. (Even if it didn’t, that doesn’t affect our point. Consider the proposition Beethoven composed the 9th symphony. The “act” of composing involved innumerable deliberate subsidiary acts.) The same is true mutatis mutandis of Smith and Jones.

But such a statement is unacceptable if taken as an analysis. There are true, and even informative, statements that cannot serve as analyses. Permit me to explain my meaning. First of all, there is surely nothing wrong with talking about hypothetical worlds – such talk is innocent. Let w be a hypothetical world. Some propositions will be true in w and some won’t. Let P be a proposition that is true in w. Since P is true in w, we can naturally think of P as associating w with the truth-value true (or the property of truth). Let w* be some other hypothetical world, but suppose that P is false in w. P associates falsity with w*. And so on, for any other hypothetical world one might consider. So it is certainly true that propositions associate truth-values with hypothetical worlds, and can thus be regarded as functions from worlds to truth-values. But propositions are functions from worlds to truth-values in the sense of “are” that indicates predication. All and only propositions have the property of assigning truth-values to worlds. But if we analyze propositions as functions from worlds to truth-values , then our statement is either viciously circular (if the worlds in question are treated as propositions) or is wrong for other reasons (if the worlds are treated as concrete objects). A comparison might be in order. It may well be true that x is the same event as y iff x and y stand in the same causal relations, i.e. if everything that causes x also causes y and if anything that x causes is also caused by y. And such a statement is not only (quite possibly) true, but also informative. But taken as an analysis of the concept of an event, that statement is circular: after all, causes and effects ere themselves events. Here is another example. Nothing that is not a proposition entails anything; and anything that is a proposition entails something. So",

Suppose that Plato snores is true in w and false in w*. In that case, w has a property that w* does not. w comprises certain states of affairs that w* does not. The space-time manifold in w has a ripple in it not had by the space-time manifold in w*. Kenneth Taylor (1998) speaks of states of affairs as “ripples in the quantum”. For Socrates to be snoring is for the quantum to be rippled or indented in a certain way (with the possible qualification that those ripples have to have certain origins). Being tall or red is a way that individuals can be. Thus tallness and redness are properties of individuals. A proposition is a way a world can be. It is thus a property of a world. This is why David Lewis (1986) explicitly identifies propositions with properties of worlds. For the proposition Socrates snores to be true in w is for w to be a certain way – it is for w’s quantum to have certain ripples in it. That proposition is thus a property, and that proposition is true in a world exactly if that proposition is instantiated in that world. We can thus identify truth with instantiatedness. A proposition P is a property of a world, and P is true exactly if that property is instantiated. Here we should deal with what would appear to be a major problem with what we’ve said so far (to avoid confusion, I’m going to put the objection in the mouth of an imaginary interlocutor):",

So it is obvious that, for some property x, Plato punched Socrates is true in a world exactly if that world has x. This point generalizes without limit: given any proposition P, there is some property P* such that P is true in a world exactly if that world has P*. But here is the problem. The proposition seems to be more basic than the corresponding property: the property must be understood in terms of the property; and the property’s being instantiated must be analyzed in terms of the proposition’s being true. This spells the doom of your analysis: for you are trying to analyze the proposition in terms of the property, and the proposition’s being true in terms of the property’s being instantiated. For (*) to be true in w, what property must (*) have? It must have p. But what is p? It is the property of being a world such that, in that world, (*) is true. So (*) is more basic than p. p is defined in terms of (*). This means that we cannot analyze (*) in terms of p; and we cannot analyze what it is for (*) to be true in terms of p’s being instantiated. On the contrary, we must analyze p in terms of (*), and we must analyze p’s being instantiated in terms of (*)’s being true.

It is always true in virtue of something about the world: mass-energy is distributed in the right way; sentient beings are having the right thoughts or feelings. A true proposition registers some fact, and the truth of a proposition supervenes on something more basic. Consider (*). It is not as though Plato just punches Socrates. Plato’s punching Socrates supervenes on facts of a much more fundamental kind: Plato punches Socrates in virtue of the fact that atom a moves in this way at this time, atom b moves that way at that time, and so on. Given two worlds where the same elementary particles move in the same way, either (*) is true in both of them or in neither. So the truth of (*) supervenes on the way in which mass-energy is distributed in the world. That distribution could obviously be described without mentioning Plato or Socrates or the relation of punching. Given any one of the electron-jumps involved in Plato’s punching Socrates, that electron-jump could obviously be described without mentioning Plato or Socrates. The same applies to each of the micro-events involved Plato’s punching Socrates. Obviously the totality of those micro-events could (in principle) be described without mentioning Plato, Socrates, or the relation of punching. That totality is plainly more basic than (*). If (*) is true in a world w, that fact supervenes on the way in which space-time is wrinkled in w. Those wrinkles underlie the truth of (*); and they can plainly be described without mentioning (*). Thus the property of having those wrinkles is more basic than (*), and the property of having those wrinkles is more basic than the concept of (*)’s being true. So there is no circularity in analyzing (*) in terms of the property a world has if it is wrinkled a certain way, and there is no circularity in analyzing (*)’s being true in terms of a world’s having the right wrinkles. There is more to say in this connection.

    "text": "IV. But the story just told isn’t quite accurate. There are a couple of reasons for this. Let p be the property that a world must have if, in it, Jones punches Smith. p will be instantiated in w exactly if, in w, there is a certain pattern of mass-energy displacements. But exactly these mass-energy displacements will suffice for the truth of infinitely many other propositions. Obviously they will suffice for the truth of every analytic proposition. (Since such propositions are true under any circumstances, it follows vacuously that whatever happens in a world is sufficient for their truth.) But those same displacements will make true somebody punches Smith and Jones punches somebody and somebody punches somebody and somebody does something intentionally. We could try to get around this. If a mass-energy displacement is enough to make true Smith punches Jones, it is enough to make true somebody punches Jones, but the converse doesn’t hold. So perhaps we could use this asymmetry to distinguish the kinds of properties associated with the patterns of mass-energy displacements. But this maneuver won’t always work. Consider the proposition x is a circle and x is a closed two-dimensional figure of uniform curvature. Surely these are different propositions; and surely in any possible world, any mass-energy displacement sufficient for the truth of the one is sufficient for that of the other. Of course, some will deny that these are different propositions. But that denial has little independent motivation – it seems an ad hoc way of ameliorating a commitment to a degenerating research program. Also, the Lewisian picture seems to make analytic propositions disappear. If a proposition is a property of a world, then what a proposition tells you is nothing more and nothing less than how a world with that property is different from a world without it. An analytic proposition is one that all worlds have. So, on Lewis’ model, analytic propositions don’t tell you anything: they might as well not exist. The problem with the view we’ve been considering is one we’ve already encountered. Propositions have decompositional structure. A proposition is not specified merely by its truth-conditions. It is necessary also to give its decomposition The Lewisian analysis just considered doesn’t accommodate the internal or decompositional differences between",

    "text": "In this world, if Jones and Smith are to exist, innumerable sub-atomic, atomic, chemical, molecular, cellular…events must occur. In any world where Jones and Smith exist, their existence supervenes on the existence of lower-level phenomena. The same is true of the relation of punching: if there is a punching, that supervenes on many other events. So no state of affairs that makes (Ap) be true has Smith or Jones or the relation of punching among its ultimate constituents. Given this, suppose we identify (Ap) with some property P such that (Ap) is true in w exactly if P is instantiated in w. In any world, an instance of P will make true many propositions whose ultimate constituents are not Smith or Jones – whose ultimate constituents are tiny displacements of mass-energy. This makes it hard to believe that P itself has a unique decomposition whose ultimate constituents are specifically Smith, Jones, and the relation of punching. If Jones manages to punch Smith, that is only by the grace of innumerable subvenient states of affairs. So P’s being instantiated demands the occurrence of subvenient states of affairs having certain properties. So it is individuative of P, and thus essential to it, that whenever it is instantiated, things more basic than Smith, Jones, and the relation of punching are instantiated. For this reason, it cannot be said with confidence that P has a unique, ultimate decomposition into Smith, Jones, and the relation of punching. On the contrary, it seems as though those three things are not among its ultimate constituents. This makes P unsuited for identification with (Ap). All of this assumes that properties themselves even have constituents. It is clear that instances of properties have constituents. An instance of the property chair has legs and a back. But it isn’t really clear if that property itself has constituents. Even if properties do have constituents, it isn’t clear if they have them in the sense in which propositions have constituents. Perhaps the property water is composed of the property hydrogen and the property oxygen. But are the last two properties constituents of the first in the very sense in which Smith is a constituent of (Ap)? This is, at best, an open question. I will argue that the answer is “no”.

For reasons already given, our including P on the list of relevant properties does not constitute a case of vicious circularity. Let me now give the motivation for this analysis. First of all, under what circumstances is (Ap) true? The following properties must be instantiated: the relation of punching (i.e. the relation x punched y); the property of being a thing x such that Smith punched x; the property of being a thing x such that x punches Jones; the property of being identical with Smith; the property of being identical with Jones; and finally P. If any one of these properties is not instantiated, then (Ap) is not true. For example, if the property identical with Smith is not instantiated, then there is no Smith; and there is therefore no Smith to punch Jones. So for (Ap) to be true, it is necessary that each of those six properties be instantiated. It is also sufficient. Suppose that each of those properties is instantiated. In that case, there is a Smith, a Jones, a case of somebody’s punching somebody, a case of Jones’ being punched, a case of Smith’s punching somebody, and a case of Smith’s punching Jones. (The instantiating of P guarantees the occurrence of the last of these.) There is more to say. The proposition (Ap) has discrete parts corresponding to Smith, Jones, the relation of punching, the property of being a thing x such that x punches Jones, and the property of being a thing x such that Smith punches x.; and (Ap) also has a (maximal) discrete part corresponding to the result of putting these together. The same thing is true of S. S has one member corresponding to Smith, one corresponding to Jones, one to the relation of punching, and so on. So S has a breakdown parallel to that of (Ap). So here is what we have thus far. The instantiating of those six properties is both necessary and sufficient for the truth of (Ap). Further, for each discrete constituent of (Ap), there is one property on that list; and for each property on that list, there is one constituent of (Ap). Here we should address a worry one...",

But it might seem that our inclusion of P on that list dooms our analysis to vicious circularity. P is the property of being a world where Smith punches Jones. So P is defined in terms of the proposition Smith punches Jones. But we are analyzing that very proposition in terms of P. So our analysis is circular. But there is no circularity. We need some way to identify that property. And the easiest way to do so is in terms of a proposition – in terms of (Ap). When we describe an event, we typically use a sentence and, therefore, a proposition. (I say “typically” and not “always” because an event can also be described through some analogue medium, like a motion picture.) We say “Smith punched Jones” or whatnot. But consider the mass-energy displacements which realize that event; consider the over-all mass-energy storm constituted by those various displacements. That storm doesn’t have remotely the kind of structure had by any of the propositions which describe it. It isn’t as though Jones can just exist. Jones’ existence supervenes on that of innumerable other states of affairs. In fact, the entity Jones is really a kind of abstraction from these various states of affairs. In the proposition, Jones is separate from his various attributes. Jones isn’t separate from his tallness, even though the proposition Jones is tall has one constituent corresponding to Jones and a discrete one corresponding to his tallness. The same is true (mutatis mutandis) of Jones’ being punched Smith. the proposition Smith punches Jones has (at least) three discrete constituents. But the event thereby described – the storm of mass-energy displacements -- is a seamless whole; in any case, so far as it does have articulations, they are not remotely like those of that proposition. There are, in principle, different ways to identify that storm. It can be indicated by ostension. In fact, that is how it was identified by those who witnessed it. (“Harry, did you see that? Wasn’t that astonishing? I never thought Smith was such a cad.?”) Of course, that event can also be indicated by description.

Qualitatively different sorts of storms can realize a case of Smith’s punching Jones. Smith and Jones can be located in any number of places and any number of times. The punch can be thrown in all kinds of different ways. And so on. So when you talk about the kind of mass-energy storm A given storm instantiates all manner of different kinds. So which kind are you talking about? You are talking about the kind instantiated by all and only those storms sufficient for the truth of Smith punched Jones. So that proposition is not merely a way of picking out a property; it enters into the very definition of the right kind of property; so your analysis is circular. (Ap) is a contingent proposition. In this context, let us focus on such propositions. A proposition doesn’t just hold. It holds in virtue of some fact – some state of affairs, some mass-energy displacement (or, more likely, consisting of such displacements). If a proposition is true in a world, there is something that makes it true – something that anchors it. Propositions aren’t free-wheeling. A true proposition is anchored to the world by a non-propositional entity. There are a couple of corollaries. First, if a proposition is true in a world, that imposes constraints on the facts constituting that world. Given that Smith punched Jones is true in w, there are some limits on how the underlying facts can be. There are some limits on what the underlying mass-energy displacements can do. A consequence is that if a given proposition is true in two worlds, then those worlds have something in common in virtue of which that proposition is true in both of them. It is not a brute fact that they are both true; the commonality is anchored in some extra-propositional commonality. If we say that there is no such commonality, we are saying that the underlying facts can be vary without limit; we are saying that the truth of that proposition imposes no limits on the underlying facts.

By contrast, (Ap) has Smith, not the property of being identical with Smith, as a constituent. Therefore, S cannot be identical with (Ap). There are (at least) two different ways we can respond to this. I don’t think that either is more correct than the other. For a long time, semanticists have insisted that Smith himself is a constituent of the proposition Smith punches Jones. But when we say such a thing, we are making an enormously theoretical claim. We don’t have any direct understanding of what propositions are. When we make some claim about what the “constituents” of propositions are, it is to accommodate various data (about modality, analyticity, cognitive content, and the like). For example, we know that that Smith punches Jones couldn’t possibly be true if there were no such thing as Smith. So this leads us to say that Smith himself must be a “constituent” of that proposition. But if there should turn out to be some other way to accommodate this modal datum, then there would be no need to insist that Smith himself is a constituent of that proposition. We have identified (Ap) with S. S’s being instantiated occurs exactly if (Ap) is true. So S’s modal properties are in lock-step with (Ap)’s. Thus if we were to analyze (Ap) as being identical with S, that would be consistent with the relevant modal data. Since that analysis accommodates the relevant intuitions about modality, we (to that extent) have grounds for thinking it is the property of being identical with Smith, and not Smith per se, that is a constituent of (Ap). Our analysis does not accommodate the view that Smith himself is a constituent of (Ap). But that view is an entirely theoretical one; it is not a datum. It is surely not a datum that Smith is a constituent of that proposition. So our analysis cannot be thrown out on the grounds that it doesn’t accommodate that view. An analysis is meant to accommodate all the relevant data – not all the relevant theoretical superstructures that have grown up over that data.

The sense in which Smith is a “constituent” of a proposition is entirely distinct from the sense in which something is a member of a set. The membership of S is not identical with the constituency of (Ap); and in order to do justice to the constituency of (Ap), we must assign members to S that are not constituents of (Ap). It is precisely in order to accommodate the fact that Smith is a constituent of (Ap) that we must make the property of being identical with Smith a constituent of S.

Given this, here is what I propose. (i) is identical with a set Si; (ii) is identical with a set Sii. Both sets contain P. But the two sets don’t have exactly the same constituency. Among the members of Si is the property of being a point; but this property is not a member of Sii. Among the members of Si is the property of having uniform curvature; this is not one of the members of Si. Each of (i) and (ii) is true exactly if all its members are simultaneously instantiated. (i) and (ii) are different propositions because, as just indicated, they have different constituencies. The truth of the one is necessary and sufficient for the truth of the other because the instancing of P is necessary and sufficient for the truth of both. The main point is that our set-theoretic analysis distinguishes between analytically equivalent but distinct propositions. Another example might be in order. The proposition",

But our analysis might seem inconsistent with another obvious fact about (#). The two constituents just mentioned combine to form some larger constituent – one corresponding to the words “Plato snores” in the verbal expression of (#). Here is the trouble. We identified (#) with a set S whose members are Ps, Pp, and P. On our analysis, P is an ultimate constituent of S – it is no less a basic constituent of S than are Ps and Pp. When we look at (#) (or, rather, at its verbal representation), it looks as though the only basic constituents of that proposition are Plato and the property of snoring. To be sure, (#) does have a third constituent – one that corresponds to some kind of putting together of the words “Plato” and “snores”. But, by all appearances, that third constituent is built out of the other two: it mustn’t be basic. But our analysis makes it basic: P is as ultimate and indivisible a constituent of S as either of Ps or Pp. Therefore, one might conclude, our analysis is wrong. I think that this objection to our analysis involves a failure to distinguish propositions from their verbal representations. It also involves a failure to appreciate how much we rely on sheer metaphor when we discuss propositions. Finally, that objection involves a failure to distinguish the psychological facts relating to the grasping of a proposition from the facts relating to the structure of the proposition itself. There is no doubt that (#) is in some sense “put together out of” Plato and the property of snoring. But there is also no doubt that this putting together has not the slightest resemblance to the putting together of a car or a building. The property of snoring is an abstract object; it cannot be put next to, or on top, or underneath anything. And given any two spatiotemporal entities, no matter how you “put them together” – no matter what kind of glue you use, no matter what kind of forklift you operate – you will not make a proposition out of them. So as for the idea that the third constituent of (#) – the “complex one” – has to result from some kind of juxtaposition of the other...",

This, of course, might lead one to think that the meaning of the whole is put together out of the meanings of the parts in something like the way that a table is put together out of legs and a slap of wood. When we say that you “piece together” the meaning of the whole on the basis of the meanings of the parts, the only thing this could mean is that you figure out the meaning of the whole sentence on the basis of the meanings of the parts. When we say that you figure this out, we can only be saying that you have hit on some dependency relation holding between the meanings of the parts and that of the whole. Once again consider the expression: “three-sided closed, planar, straight-edged figure”. That expression, as a whole, picks out the property of triangularity. On the basis of the meanings of the parts of that expression, plus a small amount of mathematical acumen, you can figure out what the expression as a whole picks out. But this obviously doesn’t mean that the referent of the whole expression is, in any literally sense, put together out of the meanings of the parts.

We saw earlier that, when we are discussing propositions, facts about “composition” and “stratification” are really facts about dependence. The same thing is true here: facts about the “ordinal” properties of propositions are really facts about entailment relations. (Ap) entails that Smith punches something; (A*p) does not entail this. (Ap) entails that Jones is punched by something; (A*p) does not entail this. And so on. When we say that, in (Ap), Smith is in one “position” and Jones is another, what we are saying is that, if (Ap) is to be true, then Jones must be doing the punching and Smith must be receiving it. We are talking about what is entailed by the truth of the proposition. So we are talking, not about position in any literal sense, but about relations of dependence and entailment. The ordinal properties of propositions are fixed by their inferential properties. Consider (Ap). We pre-theoretically know that Smith is in the “subject” position and Jones is in the “object” position. If we identify (Ap) with something x, then we must be able to retrieve the ordinal information that we pre-theoretically have about (Ap) from x. The ordinal properties of (Ap) must be fully “coded” in x. In general, an analysis of what propositions are must fully account for their ordinal properties. I believe our analysis satisfies this requirement. According to us, (Ap) is identical with a set S whose members are the following properties (remember that individuals are in fact properties)",

Obviously that property and that proposition are constituents of jsw. So jsw is identical with a set S among whose members are that property and that proposition. Here a refinement is in order. We have identified propositions with sets of properties: it is crucial to our analysis that every component of a proposition be something that can be instantiated. But, as we’ve analyzed it, the proposition that snow is white is not exactly a property; it is a set. (I don’t think that properties are sets.) In order to provide a uniform analysis, I propose this. What is a constituent of jsw is the property of being identical with that snow is white. That property is instantiated exactly if that proposition exists. We must be careful here: the property of being identical with that snow is white can be instantiated without that proposition’s being true. For the instancing of that property, it is necessary and sufficient only that that snow is white exist. To sum up, jsw is a set S; and among the members S are the property of being believed by John and also the property of being identical with that snow is white. But those cannot be the only members of S. Both of those properties can be instantiated without John’s believing that snow is white. The property of being identical with that snow is white is automatically instantiated. If John believes that grass is green (or even that snow isn’t white), then the property of John’s believing something is instantiated. So the properties in question can be instantiated with jsw being true. S must comprise some other constituent. This other constituent is not hard to identify. In worlds where John believes that snow is white, the quantum is rippled one way; in other worlds, the quantum is rippled differently. Let P be the property that a world has if, in it, the quantum is rippled in the way just mentioned. So P is instantiated in w exactly if, in w, John believes that snow is white.

Obviously this proposal is counter-intuitive. One would think that the proposition itself ought to be a member of that set. There are a couple of things to say here. First, on one delineation of the expression “constituent”, we are making the proposition that snow is white be a constituent of (jsw). But, even if we leave that aside, I think that the just mentioned counter-intuitiveness of our analysis is simply another embodiment of some very crude and false theories that we tend to have about the sense in which things are “constituents” of propositions. That Plato snores is not built out of Plato the way a building is made out of bricks. (jsw) is not built out of that snow is white the way my car is built out of metal parts. As we saw earlier, whenever we relate the notions of “constituency”, “composition”, and “part” to propositions, we are really talking about relations of logical dependence and entailment. On our analysis, the truth of (jsw) absolutely depends on some fact about the proposition that snow is white. On our analysis, (jsw) is true exactly if that snow is white has the property of being believed by John. In so far as our analysis of (jsw) is consistent with that fact, it fully accommodates the fact that that snow is white is “constituent” of (jsw) – for that “constituency” relation just is the dependency relation discussed a moment ago. (In any case, that is one way to delineate the concept of “constituency”, as it relates to propositions.) Now in order to accommodate that fact, we had to identify jsw with a set S that comprises, not that snow is white, but instead the property of being identical with that proposition. But this is in no way inconsistent with the truth expressed by statements like “the proposition that snow is white is a constituent of jsw”: for on any interpretation in which such a statement is meaningful, let alone true, that statement amounts to an affirmation of the dependence relation described a moment ago; and, as we just saw, our analysis fully accommodates the existence of that dependence relation.

So sn is a set S that has as members (inter alia) the property of being false and the property of being identical with the proposition that snow is white. (The property of falsity is instantiated in a world w iff some proposition is false in w. Presumably that property is instantiated in every world. But that needn’t concern us here.)

So we might as well identify sb with S, and identify the truth of sb with its being the case that every member of S is instantiated.

For now, I would like permission to treat the form x snores (sometimes referred to as a “propositional function” or “open proposition”) as an entity in its own right. In a moment, we will discuss what kind of entity it is. On the face of it, (ns) has (inter alia) two constituents: the propositional form just mentioned, and the property of being universally false, i.e. the property had by a thing x if every instance of x is false. So the form x is a square circle has that property, since every instance of that form is false. Let us refer to that property as UF.

We want (ss) to have a structure analogous that of those other two propositions. Also, (ss) has a certain amount of decompositional structure. The property of snoring doesn’t have any decompositional structure, at least not in the sense in which (ss) does. Given these points, this is what we say. (ss) is identical with a set (SS). (SS) has the property of being identical with the property of snoring as a member. (SS) also has the property of being instantiated as a member. Let (PT) be this property. (ss) also has a third member. Consider the way the quantum is rippled in a world where something snores. Now consider the property common to all and only worlds having that property. Let (s*) be that property. For exactly analogues of reasons considered earlier, in connection with (ns) and (es), (SS) has (s*) as a member. So the proposition something snores is identical with a set that has the following three things as members: the property of being identical with the property of snoring; (s*); and (PT). That proposition is true in a world exactly if each of those properties is instantiated in that world. This analysis is, admittedly, counter-intuitive.

In t, the facts about word-order tell you (inter alia) that Psx is a member of the corresponding proposition. In t*, facts about word-order tell you (inter alia) that Pjx is a member of the corresponding proposition. Are grammatical inflections referring terms? There are two ways we can go about answering this question. Grammatical inflections do not by themselves refer to anything; but they assign referents to sequences of expressions on the basis of the referents of those expressions. Consider t again. As a whole, t denotes the proposition (Ap). The grammar of t – the word-order, the inflection on the verb – do not themselves denote anything. But, on the basis of the referents of “Smith”, “love”, and so on, they assign referents to various complex expressions. For example, the proposition (Ap) is assigned to the whole sequence. The property Psx is assigned to the complex expression “Smith punches”, on the basis of the referents of “Smith” and the root-verb “punch”. The property Pxj is assigned to “punches Jones” on the basis of the referents of “Jones” and the root-verb “punch”. Very roughly, the general idea would be this. Grammatical inflections do not themselves refer. But when a grammatical inflection occurs in a sequence of referring terms, that occurrence assigns a referent to that sequence as a whole on the basis of the referents of the expressions composing that sequence. There is another way to look at facts about grammar. The idea would be the grammatical inflections do refer; but what they refer to is a function of the verbal environment. Consider the inflection on the verb in t. We have seen that, because that inflection occurs in that place, the corresponding proposition has Psx and Pxj as members. So we could conceivably see that inflection as denoting (or, strictly, as denoting2) those properties. When that same inflection occurs in a different environment, e.g. a token of “Plato snores”, it denotes a different thing.

Wherever Smith exists, so does a state of affairs. This is the case for a number of reasons. First, nothing is propertyless. If Smith exists, he must have a certain height, weight, and so on. So what we find in reality is never just Smith, but Smith’s having such and such properties. This is equivalent to saying: what we find is not Smith, but always some state of affairs involving Smith. Also, Smith’s existence supervenes on the occurrence of innumerable states of affairs: sub-atomic, atomic, molecular, cellular, metabolic, psychological. For modal reasons, Smith cannot be identified with the sequence of events on whose existence his own supervenes. But he is plainly inseparable from them: there but for the grace of those lower level existents goes he. The truth is that Smith is more in the nature of an abstract. He is no separable from the existence of concrete states of affairs than are instances of whiteness or roundness. People can no more exist outside of states of affairs than smiles can exist outside of people (or Cheshire cats). This suggests that Smith is really a property of states of affairs. What is it for Smith to exist in a world. The old picture is that Smith is at the bottom, and properties are heaped on top of him. This picture is reinforced by language, which gives Smith his own, semantically simple expression; and which represents the attribution of properties to Smith as the adding of gratuities to an already self-supporting entity. Presumably this fact about language has its basis in deep cognitive facts. Be all of this as it may, it is the wrong metaphysical model. We find states of affairs first. The basic constituents of a world are displacements of mass-energy, wrinkles in space-time. If those wrinkles are of such and such a type – if those wrinkles have the right properties – then Smith exists in that world; if not, not. So Smith, I would suggest, is a property of states of affairs.

The arguments proper will be given in subsequent chapters. Since this chapter simply states my views, and doesn’t put them in a broad argumentative context, much of what is said here will appear counterintuitive, even alarming. That appearance will vanish in due course. We must distinguish two quite different doctrines: we must distinguish semantic externalism from content-externalism. I will argue for semantic-externalism and against content-externalism. Content-externalism is roughly this. Let X and Y be two people who differ at most in this one respect: the causal origins of X’s states differ from the causal origins of Y’s mental states. In that case, says the content-externalist, X’s mental states may have a different representational content form Y’s mental states. X may be thinking about water, while Y is thinking about twin-water. X may be thinking about Mary, while Y is thinking about twin-Mary or perhaps about nothing (Y is hallucinating). Given two people who are exactly the same, modulo facts about the causal origins of their respective conditions, they may be thinking different things. Semantic externalism is a parallel, but distinct, doctrine. Let X and Y be two distinct entities – they could be individuals or entire populations – that differ at most in this one respect: the causal origins of X’s states differ from the causal origins of Y’s mental states. In that case, says the semantic externalist, the meanings of X’s words may be differ from the meanings of Y’s words. X may be referring to water, while Y is referring to Twin-Water. X may be referring to Mary, while Y is referring to twin-Mary or, perhaps, to nothing at all (Y is hallucinating). There can be no doubt that semantic-externalism is correct. Imagine the following. Let w and w* be two worlds that are exactly the same except in this one respect: in w, somebody x uniquely invented the zipper. In w*, there is no such person.

He has actually set foot on Hesperus (Venus/Phosphorous), and he also knows that that thing is sometimes called “Phosphorous” and is sometimes called “Hesperus”. So, for Smith, “Phosphorous is lovely” and “Hesperus is lovely” will have (nearly enough) the same cognitive value.

Let me give some additional, and independent, corroboration for my views. When are P and P* different propositions? If P entails something P* does not, that is surely enough. But, at least arguably, it is not necessary. After all, 1+1=2 and triangles have three sides entail the very same things. They are analytically equivalent. But they are different propositions. But, I would argue, there is still a difference in the entailment relations associated with these propositions. Suppose you want to prove the thesis: some kinds of shapes have three sides. If your starting point is: triangles have three sides, it will be very easy for you to prove your thesis. If your starting point is: 1+1=2, you can still prove your thesis. But the proof will be much more circuitous. Your starting point might even be the thesis itself. In that case, the proof will be completely non-circuitous: even less so than the first of the two proofs we mentioned. We might put it this way. There is an “analytic route” between some kinds of shapes have three sides and 1+1=2. And there is also an analytic route between some kinds of shapes have three sides and triangles have three sides. But those two routes are very different. The term “analytic route” is obviously vague. But it seems to correspond to some legitimate concept. Like a lawyer examining a witness, I ask the judge – you, the reader -- for some latitude. Give me this concept, and I will soon repay the loan. With some reservations, we might say this. P1 and P2 are analytically equivalent propositions just in case, for any proposition P3, the analytic route between P1 and P3 coincides with that between P2 and P3. Let us include relations of probabilification, not just entailment, in the scope of the term “analytic route”. Obviously if P1 gives 98% probability to P3, while P2 gives it 12% probability, or 0%, then P1 and P3 are not the same proposition. So, to a first approximation, we might say this.

Is there any belief that Smith-in-w can rationally hold that Smith-in-w* cannot? Of course, there are beliefs that Smith-in-w is right to have that Smith-in-w* is wrong to have. Smith-in-w, but not Smith-in-w*, would be right to believe: I am having a visual experience that is caused by Mary. So what Smith-in-w is right to believe doesn’t coincide completely with what Smith-in-w* is right to believe. But Smith-in-w is no more, and no less, rational than Smith-in-w*. In both cases, they arrived at exactly the same conclusions, in exactly the same way, on the basis of exactly the same evidence. One is wrong, one is right. But that has nothing to do with a divergence in rationality. To be rational is specifically to be adept at seeing relations of bearing (entailment and probabilification) among the information that one has at one’s disposal. (The information at one’s disposal certainly include the propositions one grasps. It is a matter of controversy whether that information coincides with those propositions. Some hold that there is non-propositional, or “non-conceptual”, information. I myself am open on this.) It follows that, if the information at Smith-in-w’s disposal is to be different from the information at Smith-in-w*’s disposal, then there must be some inference that the one can rationally make that the other cannot. But there is no such inference. So the information – and a fortiori the set of propositions - at Smith-in-w’s disposal must coincide with that at Smith-in-w*’s disposal. The externalist is forced to say that, even if two people grasp entirely different propositions, the inferences the one can rationally make may coincide perfectly with those the other can rationally make. But this move eviscerates our concept of rationality. Uncontroversially, to be rational is nothing more and nothing less than to be able to track relations of bearing among the information at one’s disposal. Obviously the propositions one grasps are, at the very least, part of such information. To say that Smith-in-w can rationally think such and such just in case Smith-in-w* can rationally think such and such just is to say that the information at the disposal of the former coincides with that at the disposal of the latter.

We must distinguish perceptual content from meta-perceptual content. Externalism is what results when these very different things are collapsed. Given only the information encoded in my perception, I have no way of knowing whether the cause of my perception is water or twin-water or some third substance. In light of other perceptions of mine, some judgment on that matter may be warranted; those other perceptions may warrant the judgment that the cause of my perception and this as opposed to that chemical structure. But if we focus on what that the perception itself tells me, I have no reason to believe anything about its chemical structure – not even that it has a chemical structure. Suppose that you have a perception of Chip. Nothing in the perception tells you that it is Chip, as opposed to twin-Chip. Given only the information encoded in the perception, it would be irrational of you to conclude that you were seeing Chip as opposed to his twin, or vice versa. Later perceptions may warrant the conclusion that Chip, and not twin-Chip, was the cause of that perception. But nothing in the perception itself warrants that conclusion. Indeed, if you were to come to that conclusion solely on the basis of the information encoded in that one perception, you would be guilty of deep irrationality. What decides the matter – what makes it rational to conclude that Chip, as opposed to twin-Chip, was the cause of your perception – lies in other perceptions that you had. So even though the perception was in fact caused by Chip, and not twin-Chip, that fact is not reflected in the information borne by the perception itself. So the information borne by Chip perception of Chip is identical with that borne by perceptions of twin-chip.

Be that as it may, practically everyone these days accepts some form of content-externalism. But, leaving aside everything we’ve so far in criticism of it, there is an obvious problem with content-externalism: it makes the representational contents of our thoughts be causally inert -- completely and totally without the ability to do anything. If externalism is right, the fact that I am thinking the number two is an even prime has no causal force; it has nothing to do with the fact that, subsequently, I think there is at least one even prime. The only properties of my organism that have any causal powers are the non-representational ones. By definition, content-externalism says that what you are thinking does not supervene on the intrinsic properties of your organism. If we leave aside facts about the causes of their conditions, X and Y can be in exactly the same condition and be having utterly different thoughts. X is thinking about Mary. Y is thinking about twin-Mary. X is thinking about Alpha Centauri. Y is thinking about nothing: in his universe, there is Alpha Centauri – so his would-be Alpha-Centauri thoughts are blanks: they contain a star-shaped blank, where X’s thoughts contain a star. The causal properties of one’s brainstates obviously supervene on their local properties. If two people have qualitatively identical brains, their brains will have exactly the same causal properties (modulo any indeterminism relating to quantum mechanics). It is totally irrelevant whether the one person’s brain bears such and such relation to Socrates, while the other person’s brain does not bear that relation to Socrates. This must be understood aright. Obviously one’s brain is causally responsive to objects that are not in its immediate vicinity. Everything affects everything. The moon affects the tides. The tides affect the climate. Because I am swimming or am a farmer who cares about the weather, the climate affects my brain-state and thus my mental state.

Surely the victim of a hallucination is being told something false (or, at best, coincidentally correct); he isn’t being told nothing. After all, the hallucinator is misled; he is told wrong (or, at best, coincidentally correct) things by his experiences; so he is not being “told” something that has free-variables in it. Narrow-content, supposing that there is such a thing – supposing that there is any distinction between it and any other kind of content – contains no free-variables or anything analogous. In light of this, what becomes of wide-content? Wide-content, if there is such a thing, is not the result of “filling out” narrow-content, of binding (or substituting for) the free variables in the latter; for there are no such variables. Wide-content would have to be an extra kind of content. So my perceptions, and my thoughts, would have two different contents, both truth-evaluable. So then we are saying that our perceptions, and thoughts, are ambiguous. But that isn’t quite right. The connection between the two kinds of content is tighter than that. The narrow kind consists in existential information. The wide kind consists of what we might call singularizations of such information. (A singularization of Sally met a man would be Sally met Harold.) Idealizing away from issues relating to the question whether sense-perceptions encode propositions (or otherwise digital information), the narrow content of my perception, and the belief I have in virtue of having that perception, is something like: there is a creature in front of me with giant fangs that is growling at me… The wide-content of my thought and belief is a singular proposition which makes true that existence claim; it is something like: Fido is growling at me. So “wide-content” becomes the truth-maker of “narrow-content”. But if we take this route, we are really abandoning externalism; we are simply re-stating, under the cloak of new terminology, the point that the truth-maker of a thought is one thing, and its content is another. Remember what we’ve said time and time again: the content of the proposition Sally met a man has nothing to do with Fred, even though Sally’s meeting Fred is what makes that proposition be true.

Kripke and Kaplan and other direct reference theorists are exactly right that the contents of our sentences do not supervene on what is “in our heads”. So semantic externalism is quite right. Putnam is quite right that what makes Oscar’s thoughts true is that H2O is wet; and that what makes twin-Oscar’s thoughts true is that ABC is wet, notwithstanding that (aside from the facts about the origins of their conditions) Oscar and twin-Oscar are qualitatively identical. That is why the of success empirical theories – theories about the microstructure of water, light, and so on -- turns on things that simply don’t supervene on our intrinsic conditions. Suppose Oscar thinks: there is some x such that I bathe in x, drink x, and swim in x, and my theory is that x is composed o f H2O. Oscar’s theory is correct. Suppose twin-Oscar thinks: there is some x such that I bathe in x, drink x, and swim in x, and my theory is that x is composed o f H2O. Twin-Oscar’s theory is wrong; for, in twin-Oscar’s case, x has chemical structure ABC. The content of Oscar’s thought is the same as the content of twin-Oscar’s thought. But the truth-makers are different. And that is why twin-Oscar’s thought, his theory, is wrong. What makes a thought true isn’t necessarily identical with the content of a thought (the two pull apart when the thought is existential, for an existential thought is always made true by a singular fact); and what we think isn’t necessarily what our sentences mean (this is the case when the sentences encode singular propositions, for we grasp such propositions through existential/non-singular ones).

When you actually see an elephant, twin-you has a hallucination qualitatively identical with your veridical perception. According to John MacDowell, the representational contents of your states have no representational content in common with your twin’s states. The evidence that is available to you is, by hypothesis, utterly indistinguishable from the evidence that is available to twin-you. For all you know, you could be twin-you. Like every philosopher since Descartes, MacDowell is aware of this. But MacDowell boldly says that, even so, what your experiences tell you – their representational contents – is utterly disjoint from what your twin’s experiences tell him (which is, strictly speaking, nothing: in terms of representational content, his waking life is one big blank even though, in terms of phenomenological content, it is as rich as yours). For this reason, MacDowell’s position is known as “disjunctivism”. From some point of view, externalists are right to be disjunctivists. As we’ve seen, if we allow that you and twin-you share any content, then we end up saying that they share all content (modulo the point about…I…--thoughts made earlier); we end up saying that their thoughts differ not in respect of content, but in respect of what their truth-makers are. A corollary of disjunctivism is that representational content is completely inert. Uncontroversially, what is causally effective is what is common to you and twin-you. Disjunctivism says that you and twin-you share no representational content. So disjunctivism entails that representational content is inert.",

Surely when we are dealing with purely conceptual truths – e.g. triangles have three sides, the existence of money presupposes the existence of animate beings, x and y are causally related only if one of them precedes the other, there are infinitely many primes -- it makes dubious sense to say that content supervenes on what obtains in remote regions of the cosmos.

The above cited passages from Kripke have induced some to hold that, at the level of literal meaning, some kind of descriptivism is true of “Hesperus” and “Phosphorous”. But in light of Kripke’s arguments, it isn’t very promising to try to re-descriptivize those names. Given Kripke’s arguments. it does seem pretty hard to believe that, at the level of semantics, they are anything other than mere labels.

One can forget any such existential information and still have a concept of the external object in question. So those existence claims are not essential to our concepts of external objects. They may be needed to start up those concepts. But then they can drop away, like scaffolding after a building has been completed. The objector is right on one thing. The “start-up” existential information certainly does drop out. I may not remember, even sub-consciously, the circumstances under which I met Sam. But this absolutely does not mean that, at any point, I have some kind of “pure” conception of the person, i.e. one that is not paved with existential information. Indeed, if such “pure” conceptions were possible, it is hard to see how it could be possible for Cicero/Tully (Hesperus/Phosphorous) cases to arise. But, I fully grant, the objector’s point definitely requires that we supplement our analysis. Suppose my first encounter with Sam is through existential information like: there is guy wearing a green shirt and a bowler hat, whom I am now (on occasion t) meeting and…and, consequently, that such information is, at least initially, implicated in my interpretetings of “Sam”. I meet Sam again, four days later. And I do so with knowledge: I recognize him. What is happening here? My recognizing him obviously doesn’t consist in my becoming aware of some bare identity; it doesn’t consist in its being the case, that for some object O, I suddenly become aware that O is identical with O. No doubt we do recognize the truth of such bare identities. But that is not what recognition consists in. Recognition is not so informationally impoverished. The story I would tell is this.

My recognizing Sam involves my seeing that some one entity satisfies both E and E*. Having made this recognition, I am at liberty to drop E. My awareness of Sam will be sustained, for the time being, by my knowledge of E*. And, in its turn, E* may be dropped and replaced by a third existence claim.

Granted, Bob himself is (part of) the representational content of that perception. But he is given to you via this existential information.

It seems to involve a false epistemology: one that makes our awareness of things less direct than it is. Let us review your analysis. You say that one makes one’s way from a token of “Hesperus” to O by way of some existence claim – one that corresponds to the peculiarities of the circumstances under which one encounters that expression. You make a corresponding claim about “Phosphorous”. Starting from these assumptions, you arrive at the conclusion that what (14) communicates to one is some existence claim, and that what (20) to one is (or may be) some other existence claim. In this way, you explain the cognitive difference between those two sentences, while conceding their synonymy. But this story is inconsistent with the fact that we are aware of objects. When you first see Venus (Hesperus/Phosphorous), you are told “That is Hesperus”. Under those circumstances, your learning the meaning of “Hesperus” involves your seeing (or otherwise perceiving) Venus. So Venus itself is an object of your visual perception. And you learn that that entity, the one we just mentioned, is the semantic content of “Hesperus”. In the story you told, your learning what “Phosphorous” means involves your having a perception of that entity. You see Phosphorous: that very entity – Venus/Hesperus/Phosphorous -- is an object of your awareness. And when you are told “that is Phosphorous”, you are learning that that very entity -- Venus/Hesperus/Phosphorous -- is called “Phosphorous”. There are no intermediaries; there is no veil of perception. A fortiori no existential propositions serve as intermediaries: you are, in both cases, aware of Venus/Hesperus/Phosphorous. In the one case, you learn that that entity is called “Hesperus”; in the other you learn that that entity is called “Phosphorous”. And that entity is safely ensconced in your awareness: you don’t need to make your way to it via any existential, or other, propositions. So, it seems to me, that the epistemological conceit underlying your analysis is quite false.

For, if the objector is right, our awareness of objects is so immediate and unremitting, and our ability to access semantic content so uninhibited and unconditional, that one could scarcely have any idea what “Hesperus” and “Phosphorous” meant without ipso facto knowing them to be co-referential. Independently of that, the objector’s point is based on a spurious epistemology. Obviously we can be aware of objects - of dogs, planets, and so forth. Barry Stroud made the profound point that perception is necessarily “predicational”. You don’t just see Fido; you see Fido as having these or those properties. In seeing an object, you necessarily “predicate” certain properties of it. I submit that once this is granted, the way is cleared for the analysis given above. Permit me to defend and delineate this view. We see objects: that much is given. You see Fido: that is a given. But you don’t just see Fido. You see a creature that occupies a certain part of space, and time; that has floppy ears and a wet nose; that appears to be under-nourished or over-nourished; that is chasing a certain other object. When you see Fido, what is given to you is not just Fido. What is given to you is the presence of an entity occupying a certain location, moving about certain ways, chasing a certain other entity…What is given to you is existential information: there is an entity occupying a certain location, moving about in certain ways, chasing a certain other entity… A perception that was just a perception of Fido would be a surd. Whenever Fido is given to you, he is embedded, so to speak, in existential information like that just described. That existential content is obviously not incidental to your perceptual awareness of Fido: there is no way to get rid of it without getting rid of the perception of Fido. Given this, it is not entirely easy to see how that existential content could fail to constitute the content of your perception of Fido. And if, under the circumstances described, you were told, while having these perceptions, “that is Fido” or (more pedantically) “our label for that thing is ‘Fido’”, then that content would figure into your subsequent cognitive reactions to...",

I’ve said that cognitive access to an object O is mediated through knowledge of existential-descriptive knowledge that applies to O. I grant that the sentence “…Gödel…” is de re about Gödel – that the semantic contribution of “Gödel” to a sentence containing that term is Gödel himself, not some concept or sense that applies to Gödel, and not some quantifier-description that turns the sentence in question into an existence-claim that is satisfied by Gödel. So up to this point, what I say is on the right side of Kripkean semantics. But I also say that one cannot grasp Gödel himself except through existential-descriptive information. Of course, to grasp the semantics of “…Gödel…” one must grasp each of the constituents of the corresponding proposition; so one must grasp Gödel. If, as I maintain, one cannot grasp Gödel except through some existential-descriptive claim, then what “…Gödel…” communicates is something along the lines of: someone x uniquely had phi and…x… Here is the problem. Kripke (1972) famously argued (or seemed to argue: see below) that people don’t typically know “uniquely individuating descriptions” of the objects to which they refer and about which they think. Practically everyone has referred to Socrates and had thoughts about him. But if asked to produce a description that uniquely applied to Socrates, nine out of ten people couldn’t do so. They would be able to produce some description, but not that one applied to Socrates to the exclusion of everyone else, and perhaps not even one that applied to him at all. They might say “he was the author of the Republic” or “he was a famous philosopher of antiquity”. This certainly seems to show that knowledge of a description that singles out x is not necessary for thinking about x. Smith may be able to think about Socrates and refer to him; but the only description Smith can associate with Socrates is some faulty or overly inclusive one (“author of the Republic”, “philosopher of yesteryear”). This consideration induced Kripke to look for an alternative. One is able to refer to Socrates, and to cognitively access the man, not by virtue of knowing some individuating description, but by virtue of having a certain causal connection to the man.

The other side of the coin is that if Fred has no uniquely individuating description of Socrates, then he isn’t connected to Socrates in the kind of way he’d have to be to refer to him or have (de re) thoughts about him. The amount of information needed to get a uniquely individuating description of Socrates is minimal. One need only hear a passing reference to the man. (Of course, seeing Socrates will do.) For then one has the uniquely individuating description : the guy referred to on occasion C (or the guy I saw next to the Oracle of Delphi, gesticulating wildly while talking about the nature of piety…) So if one doesn’t have a uniquely individuating description of Socrates, then one doesn’t even have the basis for the minimal connection needed to refer to Socrates or to think about him (in a de re way). The main point is this. Larry transfers certain abilities to Fred: the ability to use “Socrates” to refer to Socrates, and the ability to think about Socrates in a de re way. Larry’s transferring these abilities to Fred involves Fred’s acquiring a uniquely individuating description of Socrates. Of course, we can imagine Fred transmitting the powers in question to some third party – say, William. By the logic we just discussed, William’s acquiring these powers involves his (William’s) acquiring a uniquely individuating description of Socrates.

So even though (*) has a literal meaning, we cannot grasp that literal meaning. The reason, we are told, is that to have a concept of an individual, one must be causally connected to it. This point involves a radical misunderstanding of the nature of our concepts -- specifically, of the role that causal liaisons between ourselves and objects have in our concepts of those individuals. In some cases, one thinks about an object by way of a causal connection to it. But, as we just saw, the causal connection is embedded within knowledge of a uniquely individuating description of that object. In every case where we think about a spatiotemporal object, it is entirely in virtue of knowing a uniquely individuating description of that object. When I think about Socrates, it is entirely in virtue of my knowing a uniquely individuating description of that person. The descriptions need not be one of historical moment: it need not be one like the man who figured as the protagonist in most of Plato’s dialogues. It might be a pedestrian, historically insignificant one like: the guy who Fred was referring to that day when he and I were having cognac. But our concepts of external objects always involve knowledge of descriptions that single them out. Thus, there is no relevant difference between the way in which we think about the referent of “Socrates”, on the one hand, and the way we think about the referent of “Alphie” or “Julius”, on the other. In each case, the referent is grasped, if at all, by way of a uniquely individuating description. In each case, in so far as we are able to think about the referent at all, it is by knowing some concept that applies to that thing and that thing alone. These epistemological points are exactly parallel to the semantic points we made earlier in connection with the causal theory of reference. Reference is always secured by means of a description.

Unless one knows which individuals these terms refer to, one doesn’t know which propositions are encoded in “Julius was tall” and “Newman 1 will be a genius”; one has a simulated, but not an actual, understanding of what is meant by such sentences. One has knowledge of a description of the proposition which is encoded in such a sentence, but one doesn’t know which proposition is thus described. One knows that “Julius was tall” is true exactly if somebody x uniquely invented the zipper and x was tall. So it is clear that knowing who so and so is, and thus knowing the literal meanings of terms that refer to so and so, does not consist (merely) in knowing some uniquely individuating description that applies to so and so. What else is needed? The short, very approximate answer is: To identify is to re-identify. To know who so and so is, one must know of two existence-claims that are uniquely verified by so and so and, further, one must know that some one person uniquely verifies them. Suppose you meet Bob on Monday. Since you have just met him, there is a sense in which you don’t know who he is. If somebody asks you, “do you know who this is?”, you must say: “I am afraid I do not.” But, of course, in meeting him, you are uploading information that enables you to think about him – you are acquiring a concept of him. As we saw, this information is existential. Suppose that, a day later, you see Bob again. This time, there is a sense in which you know who you are seeing. As we saw earlier, your recognizing Bob consists in your knowing two existence claims of which he is the sole verifier, and also in your knowing that he uniquely verifies those propositions. That is the short answer to the question “what is it to know who somebody (or something) is?”. Here is the long answer. Identification is a contextual notion; it is always relative to some background question, or relative to some body of knowledge, that one knows, or fails to know, who somebody is.

So, according to the externalist, this difference in distal cause makes for a difference in content. But this difference in content seems to be inert. What does all the work is local: the spatially and temporally local property of Smith’s brain are what cause him to pick up the phone and dial those numbers; the same is true (mutatis mutandis) of Twin-Smith. The differences in distal cause are causally irrelevant. Everything that does causal work is in the here and now, and is lodged inside Smith’s and twin-Smith’s respective crania. It is irrelevant that Smith’s state was distally caused by Mary, as opposed to twin-Mary or hologram-Mary or Robo-Mary. Smith’s state might as well have been caused by any one of them, so far as the causal properties of that state are concerned. But if the externalist is right, then Smith and twin-Smith have qualitatively different mental contents, corresponding to the differences in distal causes. Smith is having a thought about Mary, while twin-Smith is having a thought about twin-Mary. So, if externalism is right, that difference in content is inert. What is not inert – what does all the causal work – is precisely what Smith and twin-Smith have in common; and what they have in common is neutral between Mary and twin-Mary. The fact that Smith is thinking about Mary – as opposed to twin-Mary or Robo-Mary – is without causal consequences. So far as what he is doing right now, his current condition could have been caused by any one of the three. So to the extent that mental content is to be understood in externalist terms – to the extent that Smith and twin-Smith have qualitatively different mental contents in virtue of their differing causal liaisons -- mental content doesn’t do anything.

Causes are much more specific than our statements typically indicate; and the things we describe as “causes” – somebody’s coughing too loud, a flame’s being underneath the container, the liquid’s expanding – are not really what is doing the causal work. There is always something much more specific going on: some specific molecule (or atom or quark…) bouncing off of some other molecule (or atom…). In fact, in the end, the only things that are doing causal work are specific, minute displacements of mass-energy. The flame is much too expansive and gross an entity to be responsible for the fact that this, that, or any other specific part of the pan heats up. What heats up place x on the pan is always some specific mass-energy displacement.

Put another way, it is causally relevant without being causally efficacious in the heating of the pan. What does this mean? Given that there is a flame present, it necessarily follows that something which is causally efficacious in the heating up of the pan will be present. The flame is constituted by the specific displacements which did the causal work. And the presence of a flame in that place guarantees that some such displacements will be present which will do the causal work. So even though the flame per se is not what does the work, the presence of the flame is causally relevant to the heating up of the pan: the presence of the flame guarantees or “programs for” the presence of something which would do said work. The same principle (mutatis mutandis) applies in the other cases. What causes the glass to shatter is not the fact that the liquid inside has a certain temperature or volume....",

    "text": "§ Before we deal with this formidable argument, a background point is in order. Sometimes Jackson and Pettit analyze the notion of causal relevance in counterfactual terms: x is causally relevant to the occurrence of y if, in any counterfactual circumstance where x exists, there also exists something causally effective in bringing about y. The problem is that this is too generous. My striking the glass with the hammer is sufficient, in the counterfactual sense just defined, for the breaking of the glass. Now the same is true of my striking the glass while wearing a yellow hat and having green teeth and wearing a spacesuit…But surely my wearing a yellow hat and having green teeth are not in any sense “causally relevant” to the breaking of the glass. The counterfactual analysis is too broad, too expansive. The counterfactual analysis of causal relevance needs to be tightened. But we don’t want to tighten it too much. For example, we don’t want to say that the program-cause is the smallest thing x such that x counterfactually guarantees the presence of something causally efficacious. After all, the smallest thing that gives that guarantee is the mass-energy displacement itself. But we don’t want to say that only that mass-energy displacement is causally relevant: surely we want to allow that the flame of which it is a part is causally relevant; we don’t want to shrink causal relevance down to causal efficacy. That would eviscerate the distinction between causal efficacy and causal relevance. The notion of causal relevance is, I believe, to be understood in terms of the notion of redundancy – in terms of the notion of a back-up mechanism. Consider the case where, as we loosely say, the presence of the flame caused the pan to heat up. Let x be the specific mass-energy displacements constitutive of the fire which, in the actual case, did the trick. The flame is causally relevant because in any case where you have the flame, but where x (for some reason) didn’t do the trick, the flame guarantees that some other mass-energy displacements y will do the trick. So causal relevance can be understood in terms of “back-up” mechanisms. In any situation where someone or other in the vicinity coughed loud enough, but where Smith (the actual cougher) did not cough, that is enough to make Horowitz hit the wrong key. Now Smith’s wearing a yellow...",

    "text": "Here is the right picture. The liquid expands at t. That expansion involves the occurrence of certain events E1…En. And E1…En (the specific mass-energy displacements at, or vanishingly close to, the interior surface of the vessel) cause the vessel to crack. If the liquid-expands, among the events involved in that expansion – among the events constitutive of it – are such as will be causally efficacious in the cracking of the glass. So it is not in a causal sense that the expanding of the liquid guarantees the existence of causally efficacious events. The guarantee is metaphysical (for lack of a better word): the expansion is constituted by the right kind of events. Let us bring these points to bear on the Mary/twin-Mary case. Smith decides to hit seven numbers on his phone (so as to call Mary). Mary -- or, better, some state of affairs involving Mary -- is a (contributory) distal cause of this. Let S1 be that state of affairs, that distal (contributory) cause. And let S2 be the event of Smith’s hitting those seven numbers. It may be that the occurrence of S1 in some sense “guarantees” the occurrences of S2. But the guarantee here is causal. S1 is buried in the remote recesses of space-time. (To fix our ideas, suppose that Mary and Smith haven’t seen each other in sixty years.) There is no sense in which S2 is constitutive of S1 (or vice versa). And, of course, there is no purely logical relationship between them. So the sense in which S1 guarantees S2 isn’t remotely comparable to the sense in which someone’s coughing guarantees that, for some specific x, x coughs; and it isn’t remotely comparable to the sense in which the presence of the flame guarantees the existence of the right kind of specific mass-energy displacements at, or vanishingly near, the under-surface of the pan. Now there are events which, while not themselves being causally efficacious in making Smith dial those seven numbers, do yet guarantee that he will do so, where “guarantee” is being used to denote the right logical or metaphysical relationship – the kind that holds between someone’s coughing and Smith’s coughing, between the flame’s being underneath the pan and the pan’s being heated. What is it that is causally efficacious in making Smith dial (or at least choose to dial) those numbers? Certain specific mass-energy displacements at, or vanishingly...",

    "text": "Here we might as well take an opportunity to discuss a problem that does not lie squarely on our path. We have a justification for this. The digression concerns an important matter – the viability (or rather lack thereof) of an almost universally accepted conception of the mental. And given the points we’ve just made, we are in a position to pounce on this issue. It seems reasonable to suppose that, in some cases, brain-states realize mental contents. (I wish the word “state” to be taken as broadly as possible – to apply to both enduring brain-structures and occurrent phenomena.) My belief that 1+1=2 is realized by certain brain-states. My belief that water is wet is realized by a different set of brainstates. Let x be an arbitrary brain-state of mine; and suppose that x is identical with, or realizes, my belief that bread nourishes. According to functionalism, for x to realize that belief is for x to have a certain causal role. For x to have a certain causal role is for it to be caused by certain things (e.g. visual perceptions of people eating bread and subsequently appearing sated) and for x, in its turn, to cause certain other things (e.g. my choosing to eat bread when hungry). So, for functionalism, x is a belief that bread nourishes in virtue of (inter alia) the fact that x leads to my deciding to drive to the store to buy bread, to my eating said bread, to my teaching loved ones how to bake bread, and so forth. There is an obvious problem for functionalism. If x’s realizing a belief that bread nourishes consists in (inter alia) its leading to certain states of affairs – e.g. my choosing to eat bread, my deciding to drive to the bread-store when hungry, and so forth – then x’s having that content cannot be what causes those states of affairs to come about. If x’s having that content is its having a certain causal role, then x’s having that content cannot affect or govern its causal role; it cannot be what brings about my choosing to eat bread or my teaching my loved ones how to bake it. In a word, if content is causal role, then content cannot affect causal role: content ends up not having a causal hand in contexts where, quite plainly, it does have such a hand.",

Strictly speaking, it is not things that have causal powers. It is not the rock which breaks the window, but the rock’s moving with a certain velocity, and having a certain mass, and so on. The rock doesn’t do anything. What does the work is really the rock’s having certain properties – a certain mass, solidity, velocity, and so on – along with various other things’ having various properties (e.g. the window’s having a certain micro-structure). Not every one of the rock’s properties is causally effective in every causal transaction involving the rock. Suppose the rock has a certain dimple on one of its sides. In some contexts, the rock’s having that property will be causally effective. (For example, if you pour water down that side of the rock, the presence of the dimple will affect the course of the water.) But in other contexts, the presence of that dimple will not be causally effective. (For example, if you drop the rock in a vacuum, the presence of the dimple won’t have any effect on the trajectory of the rock.) Suppose, once again, that x is a brain-state realizing my belief that bread nourishes. Strictly speaking, x doesn’t do anything: what does the work is x’s having certain properties – e.g. x’s having certain electrical, chemical, and cellular properties. Not every causal transaction involving x is one where x’s electrical properties are causally effective. Perhaps in certain contexts it is x’s mass, not its electrical properties, that are causally effective. Similarly, not every causal transaction involving x is one where x’s mental properties are causally effective. In some contexts, x’s mental properties might be causally irrelevant: what is doing the work in those contexts might be x’s having a certain electrical charge or its having a certain specific shape. So there is a difference between x’s being involved in some causal transaction, on the one hand, and x’s realizing a belief about bread being causally effective in that context. The latter might or might not be causally effective on that occasion. But, of course, we want to believe that, in at least some cases, my believing that bread nourishes is causally effective.

For the reasons just given, Smith’s wanting water cannot be causally efficacious in Smith’s reaching for the glass: it cannot, strictly speaking, be what causes Smith to do that. But it can be causally relevant. Smith’s being thirsty “programs for” his doing that sort of thing; the presence of thirst guarantees the presence of the kinds of things which would do the causal work in Smith’s reaching for the glass. So when we take into account the distinction between causal efficacy and causal relevance – between bona fide causes and program-causes – we reconcile functionalism with the presumption that the mental is causally potent. § Once again, I believe that Jackson and Pettit have had a profound insight into causality and causal explanation. But I don’t think that insight helps out functionalism in the way that they think. Let us start with some platitudes. Nothing can be “causally relevant” to itself. A state of affairs cannot be “causally relevant” to its own existence. Obviously things are relevant to themselves. But the relevance isn’t causal. Of course, the term “causal relevance” (as Jackson and Pettit are using it) is an invented one; so we can give it any meaning we wish. But surely it would be deeply misleading to describe the kind of relevance that event E has to itself as causal. The relation is better described as logical, or perhaps metaphysical. E is not causally related to itself; and it doesn’t matter whether we are taking about causal efficacy or causal relevance. Obviously the kind of relation Jackson and Pettit have in mind, when they talk about “causal relevance” is some kind of causal relation; it is not a relation which something can have to itself; the word “causal” is there for a reason. So nothing can be “causally relevant” to itself. The functionalist says that x’s causing E1…En is what x’s having C consists in. There is an identity here, not a causal relation. At the same time, it is clear, from a common-sense point of view, that x’s having content C – e.g. x’s being a desire for water – has some kind of causal hand in bringing about E1…En (i.e. that it has a causal hand in bringing it...",

    "text": "The points we’ve been discussing throughout this book allow us to weigh in on a perennial issue in philosophy: the question whether – and, if so, how – we are aware of external objects? I would like to end this section of the book by making a few remarks on this topic. There are two opposed conceptions about our epistemic relation to external reality. Some (e.g. Hume, Ayer) say that we perceive representations of external objects, and not the objects themselves: there is thus a “veil of perception” lying between ourselves and the outer world. Others (e.g. Reid) say that we perceive the objects themselves. Sometimes the former position is known as “indirect realism”: there really are external objects, but we are only indirectly aware of them – we are aware of representations of them. Predictably, the latter position is sometimes referred to as “direct realism”: there really are external objects, and we are directly aware of them, not of representational intermediaries. (In this context, I am taking for granted the existence of the external world; so it isn’t worth discussing the relations of internalism or externalism to anti-realism.) On the face of it, it might seem as though externalism is associated with direct realism, while internalism is associated with indirect realism. According to the externalism, Alpha Centauri itself is a veritable constituent of my thoughts. No Alpha Centauri, no thought. Thus, given that the thought exists, there is no need to connect the thought to external reality: if it exists at all, the thought exists connected to the external world. By the same token, indirect realism seems to be associated with internalism. The internalist says that the content of our mental states is confined to what is internal to the “Cartesian theatre”. So it would seem that, for the internalist, the content of our states does not, at least not directly, have anything to do with anything that lies outside the Cartesian theatre: Alpha Centauri is not itself a constituent of our thoughts. What is a constituent of our thoughts is, at most, something that represents Alpha Centauri. So internalism appears to be committed to the view that perceptual awareness is mediated by a veil of representations. (Let us refer to this view as VOP for “veil of perceptions.) There is some historical tendency for internalists to accept VOP – for example, Descartes accepted VOP and was an internalist,...",

Suppose you hallucinate a cat. What is the object of your awareness? A cat? There is no cat – at least, no real cat. Yet in having the hallucination, you are obviously aware. So here, it will be said, we have an awareness that is not an awareness of anything. Thus, it seems, we have a counter-example to BT. Brentano, and others, have dealt with this by saying that, when you hallucinate a cat, you are aware of a cat: a non-existent (or merely “subsistent”) cat. But this is obviously not good reasoning. Either there is a cat or there isn’t. If there isn’t, then there isn’t any cat to be aware of. Either we are simply playing with labels or we are ontologizing to cover up deficits in our reasoning. But hallucinations are not counter-examples to BT. For reasons earlier discussed, the content of your perception is existential. When you ‘see Fido’, as we put it, what your perception tells you is existential: there is a creature with such and such properties. The perception is made true by some fact about Fido. But Fido is not himself a constituent of the content of that perception. To think otherwise, we saw, is to confuse perceptual content with meta-perceptual content. Given only the information encoded in your perception, you have no way (no matter how intelligent you are) of knowing whether you are seeing Fido or twin-Fido or Android-Fido (or nothing at all). The only information that could help you decide that is meta-perceptual – information obtained through some source other than that very perception. What is given to you in that perception is neutral between Fido’s being in front of you and twin-Fido’s being in front of you and android-Fido’s being in front of you. There is nothing in that perception itself that could possibly warrant a decision as to which, if any, of these three things (Fido, twin-Fido, Android-Fido) is the one in front of you. Thus the perception cannot deliver a message of the form…Fido…(as in Fido is looking ill or Fido is panting heavily).

But it is unclear what, if anything, that sentence literally means. Suppose there turns out to be no Yeti. In that case, “Yeti” will turn out to be an empty name. So “Yeti”, in that case, would be the linguistic counterpart of a hallucination. “Yeti is ferocious” ought to encode a proposition of the form alpha is ferocious. But if there is no Yeti, then it will actually encode something with a blank in it:__is ferocious. But as we noted, “Yeti is ferocious” seems to communicate something more than:__is ferocious. It doesn’t matter whether there turns out to be a Yeti or not. There are several questions here. First, supposing that there is no Yeti, does “Yeti is ferocious” have any (complete) proposition for its literal meaning? Supposing that the answer is “yes”, what is that proposition? Supposing that the answer is “no”, how does “Yeti is ferocious” manage to communicate a significant message (as opposed to something ill-formed like __is ferocious)? And what exactly is that message? In this part of the book, I would like to show how, by combining the semantic and epistemological points made so far, we can make some headway on these matters. So we will give an analysis of empty names and, more generally, of empty singular terms. As we will see, there are different kinds of empty names. There are those associated with fiction (“Fred Flintstone”), and there those associated with erroneous beliefs as to the actual world (“Atlantis”, “phlogiston”). In this chapter, we will deal with empty names of the latter kind. It is epistemically possible that the world came into existence a thousand years ago, complete with fake memories and fake evidence of times past. (Russell made this point.) If that is the case, then “Socrates” is empty – it refers to nothing. And “Socrates was wise” doesn’t encode any proposition. But “Socrates was wise” obviously has cognitive significance.

It would make no difference if the fiction were horribly unoriginal and its content coincided with occurrences in the real world. So long as Conan Doyle was writing with the intention of producing stories, and not journalism or historiography, occurrences of “Sherlock Holmes” in those stories would not refer to any actual person, no matter what that person was called and no matter what that person did. Any correct analysis of the semantics and pragmatics of “Sherlock Holmes” must be consistent with this fact. According to the analysis we put forth a moment ago, the meaning of “Sherlock Holmes” is given through (SH) or, at any rate, some similar existence claim. But if that analysis is right, then “Sherlock Holmes” would refer to an actual person x such that x uniquely was a clever detective who lived on Baker street, played the violin, and so forth.

Vulcan turned out not to exist. The term “Vulcan” was supposed to refer. It is not a term of fiction. By contrast, “Sherlock Holmes” and “Fred Flintstone” are not even supposed to refer. Sometimes we speak of so-called “mythical” objects: Zeus, Hera, and the like. Mythical objects are not fictitious objects. “Zeus” – or its ancient Greek translation, rather – was supposed to refer. The gods were not fictions; they were posits of erroneous beliefs. (Of course, where there is wishful thinking, fiction and erroneous belief may coalesce. But let us idealize away from this psychoanalytic side-light.) Zeus and Hera are in the same category as Vulcan and phlogiston. They are not in the same category as Fred Flintstone and Sherlock Holmes. Of course, we now take it for granted that “Zeus”, “Hera”, and the like, are empty. So, to us, they are comparable to “Fred Flintstone” and “Sherlock Holmes”. When we use these terms, we are creating fiction. But to an ancient Greek, those expressions (or their translations) were not terms of fiction. Many direct reference-theorists have posited the actual existence of Zeus and Fred Flintstone. They have posited the actual existence of mythical and fictitious objects. It is clear why they have done so. A corollary of direct reference theory is that a singular term has no literal meaning if it doesn’t refer. So, strictly speaking, “Fred Flintstone is vulgar” has no literal meaning unless “Fred Flintstone” refers. That sentence obviously has cognitive significance. This last fact seems to be inconsistent with its having no literal meaning. So, it is thought, we must suppose that “Fred Flintstone” does refer. This reasoning is entirely spurious. Of course, direct reference theory does have to deal with the fact that sentences containing empty singular terms may have cognitive significance. But this is no problem at all. We need to distinguish literal meaning from communicated meaning. And we need to register a few fairly obvious facts about epistemology – in particular, that it is states of affairs involving objects, and not just objects simpliciter, that are perceived.

Intuitively, it is very hard to believe that “he” means entirely different things in each of (1)-(4). It is very hard to believe that “he” is sometimes a singular term, sometimes a bound variable, sometimes a phonetic variant of a name, and sometimes a universal quantifier. We can use Kripke’s (1977) classic argument to show that there is no semantic ambiguity here. If “he” were semantically ambiguous between these four meanings, then we’d expect there to be languages that had different words for these various disambiguations. But in every natural language L, the L-translation of “he” serves all four functions. In Spanish or Chinese or Arabic, one word does duty for “he” (bound-variable), “he” (demonstrative), “he” (pronoun of laziness), and so on. Every language will assign the same word to each occurrence of “he” in (1)-(4). A correct semantics must not make “he” be ambiguous.

What an indexical refers to is clearly subject to context-based restrictions on the domain of discourse. I wish to be understood aright. Obviously what “now” refers to depends on when it is uttered: the point I am making is not a mere re-statement of that platitude. What I am saying is that, depending on what the discursive background is, a token of “now” that occurs at a given time could pick out very different expanses of time. The word “now” – tokened at, say, 3:30 p.m. July 5th, 2005 -- could refer to this second, this minute, this day, this century, or even this geologic era. The word “here” – tokened in Washington D.C. -- could refer to this exact spot, this neighborhood, this country, or even this galaxy. Some indexicals involve accompanying acts of ostension; others do not. If you say “that is a beautiful house”, your use of the word “that” may or may not involve a demonstration: an act of pointing. If there are several salient horses, you would probably have to point to a specific one to make yourself understood. But if you said “today is a fine today”, no act of pointing could possibly be involved. Kaplan refers to indexicals like “today” as “pure”, and to indexicals like “that” as “impure”. It should be noted that, even with impure indexicals, an act of ostension isn’t always involved. If there is only one contextually salient horse, you can say “that is a lovely horse” without pointing to anything: the word “horse” directs the auditor to look for a referent for “that” within a hyper-restricted domain. He will look, not just for contextually salient objects (of which there are many), but for contextually salient horses (of which there are relatively few). But if there are many contextually salient horses, you must restrict the domain even further. One way is to point to some horse. If you simply say “that [no act of pointing] is a lovely horse”, the auditor’s search-space is too large; it includes too many horses. If you say, “that [pointing to Napoleon or Secretariat] is a lovely horse”, the auditor’s search space has been hyper-restricted; the domain of discourse – the sphere within which the auditor is to look for a referent...",

It will usually be perfectly clear which of these things is being referred to. But the point is that, by itself, the act of ostension can never completely pinpoint an object: all it can do is to restrict the domain of discourse enough to enable the auditor to figure out what you are referring to. Oftentimes, an act of ostension is not enough to effect the needed delimitation of context. We need to add a sortal term to the indexical: we need to use a complex demonstrative. Suppose you and I are looking at a field where there are many different animals. If I just point and say, “that is a lovely beast”, you will have no idea whether I am referring to the sheep, the goat, or the horse. I must say “that horse is a lovely beast”.

If you point to somebody and say “he”, your act of pointing delimits the domain of discourse. The word “he” comprises a phonetically telescoped sortal: male. With the possible exception of “this” and “that”, all indexicals contain (phonetically distorted) sortals. “today” obviously contains the sortal “day”; “now” contains the sortal “time” (“now” is short for “this time”); even “it” contains a sortal (a very inclusive one): “entity” or “thing”. Even “this” and “that” probably contain sortals. Obviously “this” and “that” have different meanings; the only way to explain this is to say that the characters of “this” comprise different sortals.

Second, the sortal information in demonstratives is there to restrict the domain of discourse. In all cases, indexicals refer to the contextually salient object having the relevant sortal properties.

If you utter (SN), and yet there is no contextually salient senator, your utterance will obviously be abortive. Some definite descriptions always refer to the same thing, e.g. “the sum of two and three”. What these expressions refer to seems not to be a function of contexts: they refer to the same things in all contexts. Thus, it might appear, my analysis is wrong. I would argue otherwise. We must not confuse matters of semantics with matters of logic or metaphysics. For reasons of logic or metaphysics, only one entity can possibly instantiate the sortal concept encoded in: “the sum of two and three”. Since there is only one conceivable instance of that sortal concept, that entity will inevitably be the salient instance of that concept. If you say “the sum of two and three”, there is only one entity that, under any circumstances, could conceivably be the contextually salient instance of the relevant sortal. So, by default, that entity is always the contextually salient instance of it. So “the sum of two and three” is, semantically, just like “the strong man in the corner”. Of course, in the one case, but not the other, different things can instantiate the relevant sortal information. But that has to do with the logic of the relevant sortal concepts; it doesn’t have anything to do with semantics. If we lived in a world where the sum of two and three was four in some places and was six in others, then “the sum of two and three” would be as context-sensitive as “the man over there”. There can be no doubt that, if we leave aside our semantic theories, and consider our intuitions, tokens of “the phi” seem to refer to the contextually salient phi. If you say “the dog looks ill”, the definite description certainly seems to refer to the contextually salient dog; if you say “the house looks wonderful”, the definite description certainly seems to refer to the contextually salient house.

What is going on in (^) is just what Evans, Bach, and others thought. The first clause describes something. The second refers to the thing described. Things are sometimes made cognitively, and therefore referentially, available to us through existence claims. (^) is simply an instance of this phenomenon. People and things are often identified descriptively. “Socrates was the philosopher who drank hemlock”. “Mercury is the planet closest to the sun”. We are obviously able to refer to things to which we are introduced through descriptions. (The descriptive information merely fixes the referent; it doesn’t give the meaning. That is why our modal intuitions are not corrupted; and that is why “Socrates” and “Mercury” designate rigidly.) I believe that sense-perceptions encode descriptive information, and that even when one acquires a concept of something through-sense perception, knowledge of a description is still involved: the guy standing over there, the dog I’m looking at right now, the man in the red car. Ostensive definitions involve sense-perceptions; and, for this reason, it is thought that ostensive definitions are not descriptive. But it is precisely because ostensive definitions involve a sense-perception of the thing ostended that they are, in effect, descriptive. When you point to something and say “that is atrocious”, your ostension works only in so far as the auditor has a perception of the thing indicated. That perception will necessarily be descriptive. From his viewpoint, it will be given by a description like the man over there, next to the tree. So ostensive definition is not, I believe, to be contrasted with descriptive definition: the former is a species of the latter. I believe that, E-pronouns, like the “he” in (^), are not cases of so-called anaphoric reference. (I say “so-called” because, as we’ve seen, “anaphoric reference” is an oxymoron.)

No proposition of the form O has psi is logically equivalent with any proposition of the form something x uniquely has phi and any such thing has psi.

But Grice also granted – what cannot be denied – that “shyster” and “lawyer” are not interchangeable. He said that this non-interchangeability had to do with pragmatics -- with implicature. There is an obvious difference between this kind of implicature – if implicature be the right term -- and the kind mentioned a moment ago. The value-judgment attaching to “shyster” is not a function of the conversational context. Any use of “shyster” bears the message that lawyering is a dishonorable profession: that message is endemic to the word. Grice recognized this. Grice refers to this kind of implicature, if implicature be the right word, as “conventional implicature”. Conventional implicature is not “cancelable”. This is a corollary of the fact that it is not context-dependent. So, in Grice’s view, “hooker” and “courtesan” are synonyms; they differ, not in semantics, but in implicature. The same is true of “f**k” and “make love”, “janitor” and “custodial engineer”, and so forth.

You say “the woman wearing the blue wig is a partner at my law-firm”. Here there is some specific woman x such that you have x in mind and you are making a statement about x. The definite description – “the woman wearing the blue wig” – encodes descriptive information. But you are using that information only as a means of picking about some particular individual; the statement you are making is about that individual, not about the concept woman wearing a blue wig. The definite description is being used to refer to that woman; it is being used “referentially”. You are not saying anything about the concept woman wearing a blue wig; you are using that concept to identify the thing about which you are making a statement. In some cases, the descriptive information actually figures in the proposition being made. Suppose you have no idea who the president in 2045 will be. You say",

You are not saying that Harry will have a hard job, or that Frank or Fred or any other specific individual will have a hard job. You are making a statement about the very concept of being a president in 2045: you are saying that any instance of that concept will be an instance of some other concept (will have a hard job). The referential-attributive distinction is a legitimate one. Whether it is a matter of semantics or merely of pragmatics is another matter: one we will weigh in on shortly. Everybody thinks that, at last prima facie, Russell’s theory is in conflict with the fact that definite descriptions can be used referentially. After all, Russell’s theory just is the thesis that definite descriptions are not singular terms. But it is generally taken for granted that Russell’s theory is perfectly consistent with attributive use of definite descriptions. It is always assumed that, if you use “…the phi…” in an attributive manner, you are using that sentence to assert:",

    "text": "Bob’s statement is deviant. He seems to be presupposing the very thing that, under the circumstances, he should be asserting. This is not a nuance. If Bob thought that (ii) was as responsive as (i) to your question, he would be guilty of serious linguistic incompetence. Here we are dealing with linguistic competence, not with unresponsiveness to the unstated protocols governing interpersonal discourse. A slight detour will put this in context. Suppose you ask Fred “I’m running low on gas. Is there a gas station nearby?”. Fred says: “there is a gas station around the corner.” You drive around the corner; there is a gas-station there. But it has obviously been closed for years. There are two possibilities here. First, Fred was intentionally being obstreperous; he knew that the gas-station was closed, and he intentionally misled you. Second, Fred is stupid; he didn’t mean to mislead you; he tried to answer your question; but, because he is so stupid, he answers the question you were literally asking, not the one you were really asking. In the first case, Fred is clearly not guilty of any kind of incompetence; he is simply being immoral. In the second case, Fred is guilty of some kind of incompetence. But is it linguistic incompetence? Is the problem that Fred doesn’t have a mastery of the English language? No. The problem is a more general form of cognitive incompetence; his linguistic competence is unexceptionable. Fred’s torpid mind cannot track the unstated understandings that bridge the gap between literal meaning and speaker’s meaning. But Fred is not guilty of linguistic incompetence, at least not in this context. But suppose Bob says (ii), instead of (i), in response to your question. That does show linguistic incompetence. That is not a function of garden-variety stupidity; that shows a deficit in semantic knowledge. We are not dealing with garden-variety obtuseness. There is no doubt that any utterance of (ii) must be taken attributively. (In any case, it must be taken attributively until it is known who the president in 2045 is. Thereafter, that sentence could be given either referential or attributive readings.) But we’ve just seen that (i) and (ii) are quite definitely not interchangeable. So (i), even when meant attributively, is by no means interchangeable with (ii). Another example might help. Consider the following dialogues:",

    "text": "The definite description in (ii) refers to x: it refers to the person described in the antecedent existence claim. Kuczynski’s analysis harmonizes with a point that Kripke makes and that we generalized. Reference is always fixed by existence claims. Suppose you ask “who was Socrates?” and you are told “Socrates was the protagonist in most of Plato’s dialogues.” Here what you are being told is: somebody x was uniquely a protagonist in most of Plato’s dialogues, and “Socrates” refers to x. We observed that, even in cases of ostensive definition, reference is fixed by existential information. (The existential information is encoded in the perceptions accompanying the ostension; it is not verbal, at least not entirely.) Reference is thus always parasitic on understood, antecedent existence claims; and Kuczynski’s analysis seems consistent with this. I do not know whether the solution just described is correct. But I would suggest that there is a simpler one. For the sake of argument, suppose that the referentialist is right. In that case, the semantic rule for “the president of the U.S. in 2045” is this:",
