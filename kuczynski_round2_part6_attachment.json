    "text": "The basic tenet of Attachment Theory is that a person's emotional attachments influence the way in which he deals with problematic situations and, moreover, that the way in which he deals with problematic situations influences his relations to others. Attachment Theory is not a single theory but a cluster of theories all based on this tenet."

This knowledge seems to be embodied in parental instincts, given that parents, especially mothers, are naturally inclined to bond with their children, especially when they are young and vulnerable."

A mother's love leads to self-love, according to Freud, and a father's discipline leads to self-discipline, with a person's success as an adult depending on his having a healthy combination of self-love and self-discipline."

Bowlby observed that the children who reacted the most violently to separation from caregivers were the first to be given substitute-caregivers and were therefore the most likely to survive. On this basis, Bowlby hypothesized that these extreme behaviors were survival mechanisms that were reinforced by natural selection."

Bowlby held that a person's ABS is largely determined by the nature of his early-life relationships with caregivers. Bowlby also held that in order to become a healthy adult, a child needed to have at least one stable attachment with a caregiver."
