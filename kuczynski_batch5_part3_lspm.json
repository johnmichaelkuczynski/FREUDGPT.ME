Chapter 2 Set Theory and Logic (2015) Introduction Statements about number are encrypted statements about order. Mathematics is the study of ordinal relations. Any given truth concerning ordinal relations is equivalent with a truth of set-theory. Set-theory is the smallest class of truths consisting solely of the following concepts: ∅ The empty set ∈ The relation between class-member and class ⊂ The relation of subset to set Not And Or If…then… Identity All Some Property Relation In the present work, it will be shown that truths about seemingly exotic mathematical entities (e.g. complex numbers, formal languages, ndimensional manifolds) are identical with truths consisting solely of the justnamed concepts. It will also be shown that all of the truths of mathematical logic and all of the core truths of philosophical logic can be understood in terms of those concepts. Mathematical logic is the discipline that codifies the rules of inference involved in mathematical reasoning. Philosophical logic is the discipline that identifies the scope and limit of mathematical logic.

    "text": "* ∀ K( ∅⊆ K) Explanation: Given that nothing belongs to any empty set, it follows that any given empty-set is membership-identical, and therefore identical, with ∅ . 3.2 The concept of an enlargement In mathematics, it is often necessary to considered ordered n-tuples (K, O1, O2…On), where K is a class and Oi (1≤i≤n) is an operation that is defined for m-tuples (m≥1) whose members belong to K. Thus, ( ℕ , +, ×) defines the class of arithmetical truths. In the expression “( ℕ , +, ×)”, the occurrences of “+” and “×” denote relations that hold between cardinal numbers. They do not denote relations that hold between signed integers (e.g. −8, +3) or between rationals (e.g. ¾, ½) or, therefore, between signed rationals (e.g. −3/4, +7/8). (For reasons yet to be disclosed, +5 is not the same entity as 5.) Therefore, if ℤ is the smallest class containing both +n and –n, for every cardinal n, then, in “( ℤ , +, ×)”, the occurrences of “+” and “×” do not denote the same relations as their homonyms in “( ℕ , +, ×).” Taking + ℕ and × ℕ to be the second pair of relations and + ℤ and × ℤ to be the first, + ℕ and × ℕ denote relations between unsigned integers, whereas + ℤ and × ℤ denote relations between signed integers. Nonetheless, for obvious reasons, given any truths of the form α + ℕβ=γ and α× ℕβ=γ there are analogous truths of the form α+ ℤβ=γ and α× ℤβ=γ. To that extent, ( ℤ , +, ×) may be said to correspond to (though not to coincide with) ( ℕ , +, ×). At the same time, there are truths in ( ℤ , +, ×), e.g. 5−8=−3, that do not have counterparts in ( ℕ , +, ×). To that extent, ( ℤ , +, ×) is larger than ( ℕ , +, ×). Thus, ( ℤ , +, ×) may be said to be an enlargement of ( ℕ , +, ×). But ( ℤ , +, ×) is not a superset of ( ℕ , +, ×), given that the two statement-sets are disjoint. In general, (K, O1, O2…On) is an enlargement of (K*, O*1, O*2… O*m) if, for any statement in (K*, O*1, O*2…O*m), there is an analogous statement in (K*, O*1, O*2…O*m) but not vice...",

A onedimensional series is a continuous series whose members are not themselves series. An n+1 dimensional series is a continuous series each of whose members is an n-dimensional series. Thus, a 2-dimensional series is a continuous series whose members are one-dimensional series. Given that real numbers are positions in one-dimensional series, it follows that pairs/triples/n-tuples of real numbers are positions in two dimensional/three-dimensional/n-dimensional series. When n>2, an n-tuple of real numbers is a vector. Complex numbers are positions in 2-dimensional series and they are therefore vectors. (Strictly speaking, complex numbers are complex numbers are pairs of signed reals, not reals per se. We will revisit this point later.)

A discrete series is one whose every non-terminal member has an immediate successor. ( ℕ ,<) is a discrete series. A discrete series is a recursively defined class of pairs (x, x*), where x is a cardinal number and x* is a member K, for some class K. For example, Let S0 be the series: 0, 1, 2, 3,… In S0, 0 has the first position; 1, the second; 2 the third; and so on. Therefore, S0 is identical with the class of pairs S0 is identical with the class of pairs (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4),…. For analogous reasons, if S# is the series: 1, 4, 9, 16,… S# is identical with the class of pairs: (1,1), (2,4), (3,9), (4,16),…. S0 and S# may be identified with, respectively, K0 and K#, where K0={(x,y): ∀ x(x ∈ℕ⋀ (x=0→y=1) ⋀ (x>0→y=(x+1)}, and K#={(x,y): ∀ x(x ∈ℕ⋀ (x=0→y=1) ⋀ (x>0→y=(x+1)2}. K0 and K# are unordered classes. Any given series σ may be identified with an unordered class κ of pairs (x,y), where x ∈ℕ and y ∈ κ, provided that, if z ∈ κ and (n+1, z) ∈ Σ, then (n+1, w) ∈ Σ, where w ∈ κ. S0 and S# are generated by, respectively, ϕ0 and ϕ#, where ϕ0(0)=1; ϕ0(n+1)=1+ϕ0(n) and ϕ#(0)=1; ϕ#(n+1)=(n+2)2. Each of these functions is a recursive function.

There is no rational that does not occur on SR. 5.0 Relevant principles of set theory and logic 5.1 [ℚ ]=[ ℕ ] Any two classes that can be recursively defined have the same cardinality. A recursive definition of a class K is one that bijects K and ℕ . (A bijection is a one-one function.) Therefore, any recursively definable class has the same cardinality as ℕ . Therefore, [ ℕ ]=[ ℚ ], i.e. there are exactly as many naturals as there are rationals. 5.2 [ℚ ]<[ ℝ ] A list, as we will be using this word, is simply a graphic representation of the elements of a class. If k is infinite, the elements of a class k can be listed just in case k is recursively definable. The elements of ℕ can be listed, as can the elements of ℚ . Proposition: The elements of ℝ cannot be listed. Proof: Given any top-down list of elements of ℝ , expressed as nonterminating decimals, there is a number, namely D(L) (read: the diagonal of L), that is not in L, where D(L) is generated by a function ϕ that associates m with m+1 when m<9 and otherwise associates m with 0, where m is the figure in the nth decimal place in the nth member L. Since, for any sequence L, D(L) is a real number, there is no sequence containing every member of ℝ . Therefore, there is no enumerative definition of ℝ . Therefore, there is no recursive definition of ℝ . Since D(S) ∉ S, where S is any sequence of real numbers, it follows that [ ℝ ] is larger than [K], where K is any class, such as ℕ or ℚ , that can be recursively defined. Therefore, [ ℝ ]>[ ℕ ] and [ ℝ ]>[ ℚ ]. The technique just used is known as diagonalization, the reason being that D(L) starts at the top left of L and moves in a straight line towards the bottom right.

There are many reasons why no scientific discipline can be formalized. Some of these reasons will be identified below. But right now, let us resume our discussion of the rudiments of set-theory and formal logic. 5.4 PK=2[K] Proposition: Given any class K, [Pk]=2[K]. In other words, if n is the number of members of K, the number of subsets of a class K is 2n. Proof by induction: If K is empty, i.e. if [K]=0=n, 2n=1, given that the empty set, being a subset of any given set, is a subset of itself. As for cases where [K]=n and n>0, suppose that for some n, [PK]=2n, where [K]=n. If α ∉ K, for arbitrary α, then α ∉ k, where k is an arbitrary subset of K. Therefore, for each subset k of K, k ∪ α ∉ K. This means that, if K*=K ∪ α, then, for any subset of k of K, k is also a subset of K* and, moreover, k ∪ α, is also a subset of K*. Thus, K* has two subsets for every one subset of K. Consequently, [PK*]=2n×2=2n+1. Since, by hypothesis, [PK]=2n, it follows that [PK*]=2n+1.

This means that if K is finite, [K]<[PK]. We will now show that [K]<[PK] even when K is infinite. Assume arguendo that K≈PK. That means that there is a function ϕ that bijects K and PK. Define a subset k of PK such that, whenever x ∈ K, x ∈ k just in case x ∉ ϕ(x). Suppose that ϕ(α)=k, where α ∈ K. If α ∈ k, then α ∉ ϕ(α); and if α ∉ k, then α ∈ ϕ(α), then α ∈ k.

The hypothesis that 2 ℵ n= ℵ n+1 is known as the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis. 5.9 Irrational numbers in relation to continuity Given any two rational numbers, there is an irrational number in between them. Since there is a rational between any two rationals, it follows that there are infinitely many irrationals between any two rationals. Given any two rational lengths (lengths that are given by rational by numbers), it follows that there are infinitely many intermediate irrational lengths. Therefore, an object’s length cannot increase all without assuming infinitely many irrational values. Therefore, for any length L, if, for any length L* such that L*≤L, the ratio of L*’s length to L’s is rational, then L is vanishingly short. Therefore, unless n≥ ℵ 1, any length consisting of n-many points is vanishingly short. Therefore, unless n≥ ℵ 1, no occupant of a manifold consisting of nmany points can have a positive length. Consequently, no such occupant can to any degree grow or otherwise length-change. Therefore, no such occupant can change in respect of its area (since area≈length squared), volume (since volume≈length cubed), rate of motion (since rate of motion=displacement/time), mass (since mass≈resistance to displacement), or density (since density=mass/volume). Therefore, if m is the area, volume, mass, density, or rate of motion of any such occupant, m is at most vanishingly small. This means that any manifold that can host change, i.e. any spatiotemporal manifold, consists of non-denumerably many points. This in turn means that a mathematical system is powerless to describe such a manifold unless that system grants the existence of classes whose cardinalities exceed ℵ 0. And this in its turn means that no recursively definable set can describe such a manifold. 5.10 Two conceptions of cardinality Given two classes k and k*, the statement (0) [k]=[k*], i.e. k has the same number of members as k*, is ambiguous between (C1) k≈k*, i.e. k...",

It is an infinitely large class of cardinals any two of whose elements can be bijected. As for finite cardinals, they too are classes of cardinals, with the qualification that any such class only has one member. Thus, C1 represents a viable conception of cardinality-type, whereas C2 represents a viable conception of cardinality-proper. Where finite cardinals are concerned, there is only instance of any given cardinality-type, a consequence being that C1 and C2 are output-identical (extensionally equivalent) with respect to finites. But there are multiple instances of any given transfinite cardinality-type, and C1 and C2 are therefore output-distinct with respect to transfinites. George Cantor (1884) developed an arithmetic of transfinites, described in toto in Section 6.0. According to most authorities, Cantor’s system rests in its entirety on the supposition that C2 is simply erroneous, C1 being the only viable conception of cardinality.

An incompleteness proof is simply a proof that, for some class C, there is no recursive definition of C. For example, the non-recursivity of ℝ is really a consequence of the fact that [PK]>[K]. To say that [PK]>[K] is to say that, if R is the recursion that generates K, then R does not generate PK. Let R* be the recursion that generates an arbitrary list (or class) L of real numbers. In that case, R* does not generate PL (the power-set of L), even though, given that L is recursive, so is PL. That said, the union of the elements of PL itself defines a real number. Hence, the non-recursivity of ℝ . The non-recursivity of ℝ is a consequence of the fact that there is no recursive definition of the class of all logically true statements. Explanation/proof: A statement-class is a class of true statements. A logic is a recursively defined class of true statements. I.e. a logic is the posterity of S with respect to Φ, where S is a true statement and Φ is a truthtransmissive operation, meaning that Φ(σ) is true, for any true statement σ. Kurt Gödel’s celebrated (1931) incompleteness proof is to the effect that the class of all arithmetical truths is incomplete. A truth of arithmetic is one concerning such interrelations between integers as can be expressed in terms of the following concepts: 0, +, ×, some, all, negation, set-membership, and property. Gödel’s theorem is really a special case of a more comprehensive principle, namely, that the class of recursive definitions is not itself recursively defined. Given any class k, there is an associated statement-class s(k). If k is itself a statement-class, then k=s(k). If k is not a statement-class, then s(k) is the smallest class of truths of the form x ∈ k. k is recursive just in case s(k) is recursive, and there is a one-one correspondence between K and S(K), where K is the class of recursive definitions and S(K) is the class of recursively There is a one-one correspondence between the class of recursively defined classes and the class of recursively defined statementclasses.

Explanation: It is a datum that English and Spanish and other socalled natural languages are, indeed, languages. Any given natural language contains infinitely many sentences. This is because any given sentence or n-tuple of sentences belonging to a given natural language can be combined into a new sentence, e.g. “snow is not white” can be converted into “John is happy about the fact that snow is which”, which in turn can converted into “John is happy about the fact that John is happy about the fact that snow is white”, and so on. Therefore, a ‘language’ that contains only finitely many expressions is but a caricature of a bona fide language. At the same time, no natural language, and therefore no language in legitimate sense of the word, contains non-denumerably many expressions. A language is a class of comprehensible expressions. (Indeed, “incomprehensible expression” is a veritable oxymoron.) If L is an infinitely large expression-class, it is not possible to memorize the meanings of L’s members. Therefore, L-expressions, if understood, are understood on the basis of other L-expressions. To say that one expression S2 is understood on the basis of some other expression S1 is to say that, for some recursion Φ, it is already known that:",

The class of natural languages is a proper subset of the class of formal languages. When a language L is described as “formal”, what is meant is that it can be immediately be said exactly what Φ and Ψ are, where Φ is L’s syntax is and Ψ is L’s semantics. This condition is obviously met where artificial languages are concerned, simply because, given any such language, we stipulate what those values are. This condition is not met where natural languages are concerned, since we don’t stipulate what those values are and therefore have to figure out what those values are. And given how expressively rich natural languages are, it cannot be readily figured out what Φ and Ψ are. But their approximate values can be determined quickly but non-immediately, and their specific values can be determined non-immediately and non-quickly. That said, there is one intrinsic difference between formal (artificial) and natural languages, namely, that any given natural language is really hierarchy of languages. What this means, and why it is true, will presently be made clear. 8.0 Definition of “formal truth” Logic is often described as the study of “formal truth.” Depending on how it is taken, this characterization is either meaningless or false. An individual logic L is a recursively defined class of true sentences. To say that a given a sentence Sn is formally true is to say that that Sn belongs to the posterity of S1 with respect to ϕ, where S1 is a true statement (or class of true statements) and ϕ is a truth-transmissive function. If that condition is met, then Sn is formally true with respect to (S1, ϕ). But given any true statement σn, there are infinitely many pairs (σ1, Φ), where σ1 is a true sentence and Φ is a truth-transmissive function, such that σn is not formally true with respect to (σ1, Φ). Thus, the concept of formal truth is a relative notion. The class of recursive statement-classes is non-recursive. We proved this earlier. It follows that the class of logics is...",

Only one of these views (Platonism/realism) has even a chance of being correct.

The fact that \"35,247×254=8,952,738\" means 35,247×254=8,952,738 is a logical consequence of our conventions, and that fact is therefore convention-based, but not convention-determined. Given that 35,247×254=8,952,738 is true, it follows \"35,247×254=8,952,738\" is true. Since that expression's having that proposition for its meaning has a basis in convention, and since that expression's being true is a consequence of that proposition's being true, that expression's being true has a basis in convention. But there are two respects in which that expression, though true, is not definitionally so. First, \"35,247×254=8,952,738\" is not defined to me 35,247×254=8,952,738; its having that meaning is a logical consequence of conventions. Second, that meaning's being true is to no degree conventional; so even though that expression's bearing that meaning has a basis in convention, that meaning's being true has none. It is therefore quite as misconceived to say that \"35,247×254=8,952,738\" is true by convention as it is to say that \"snow is white\" is true by convention.

It turned out that 6 lb. bricks jointly weigh slightly more than 6-times one lb. brick; and it turned out that a billion one ton bricks weigh vastly more than a billion-times one 1-ton brick. If arithmetical truths registered empirical facts, we'd have to adjust the laws of arithmetic with every such advance in our empirical knowledge. But we don't. The arithmetical norms remains fixed—as norms must—and we evaluate the empirical facts in light of those norms. For argument's sake, assume, with Mill, that: (1) If 6 bricks jointly have ten times the mass of 1 brick, then 6(1)=10. In order to know that (1) is true, we must be able to correlate the number of bricks in a bag with the aggregate mass of those bricks. That means that, when counting those bricks, we must use the usual arithmetical norms---we must assign \"1\" to one of those bricks, \"2\" another of those bricks, and so on, until each brick has been assigned a number. Setting aside the irrelevant possibility that there has been a change in the contents of the bag, the last number assigned is necessarily 6. The arithmetical truth that 6(1)=6 is the just-stated truth, or a generalization thereof, and (1) therefore assumes the very truth it negates, namely, that, when counting bricks, 6(1)=6 (and, therefore, that 6/2=3 and 6/4=3/2, etc.). (1) is therefore to the effect that (i) 6(1)=6 and 6(1)≠6, and it is therefore false. The laws that coordinate the consequences of arithmetical operations (e.g. adding 1) with the consequences of physical operations (e.g. placing a brick in a bag) are not themselves arithmetical laws.

The laws of nature, though not themselves mathematical laws, must be mapped onto mathematical laws if we are to generate accurate predictions or, therefore, explanations. (Explanation is retrodiction--back-tracking prediction. Hence the \"therefore.\") More precisely, if, on the basis of natural law, we are to be able to predict/explain anything, we must have mapped natural laws onto syntactic laws (laws assigning expressions of a given language with other, more complex expressions of that same language). Thus, oddly, mathematics turns out to be a kind of linguistics; and poets (and philosophers) turn out to be mathematicians, albeit ones whose data-sets, unlike those of physicists, are not best organized by calculi that are capable of numerical interpretations and whose calculi, only partly for that reason, are prohibitively difficult to state with any precision and, consequently, are unknown even to those most adept at operating with them. Thus, we can take (1) to mean: (1*) A formal calculus, though not itself a body of physical truths, is of interest because it has a physical interpretation. When mathematicians choose to study this as opposed to that formal calculus, it is because, the empirical facts being what they are, he has reason to believe that this one, and not that one, has a physical interpretation. Thus taken, (1) is a distorted way of expressing an important truth. We can go further in this direction. The class of mathematical truths obviously isn't confined to calculus-internal truths. In fact, calculus-internal truths aren't mathematical truths; though they register facts about mathematical truths. Mathematics is the study, not of this or that formal calculus, but of relations between calculi, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, arbitrarily chosen statement-sets. Mathematical truths are not given by theorems (e.g. \"1+2=2+1\") or even by metatheorems (e.g. \"a+b=b+a\"); for, as these examples show, theorems and metatheorems are calculus internal. (\"a+b=b+a\" is false if a and b are infinite.) By the time it's possible to identify theorems and metatheorems, all the real work has been done: the relevant calculi have been invented and the general nature of their consequences, though not their precise identities, have therefore already been determined.

Suppose that, in order to turn SW into a true statement, we adopted a fourth convention: (4) \"Snow is white and it is not the case that snow is white\" is true if snow is either white or snow is not white. 4 is not consistent with 1-3: 1-4 are an inconsistent set of semantic rules.

Stipulations are arbitrary and ipso facto don't follow from anything. Chapter 6 The so-called Laws of Logic (2014) The cornerstones of Classical Logic (CL) are (LEM) The law of Excluded Middle: (p)(p or ¬p) (any given proposition is either true or false) and (LNC) The law of Non-Contradiction: (p)¬(p & ¬p) (no proposition is both true and false) It is often said that LEM is false, sometimes on the grounds that there are different degrees of truth and sometimes on the grounds that some propositions are neither true nor false.[1] LNC is more widely accepted than LEM, even though they are equivalent. (p or ¬p is what results when the outer negation sign ¬(p&¬p) is distributed and the “and” sign is duly replaced with an “or.”) In any case, the debate is made of straw. LEM is neither true nor false. LEM can be rejected so long as the remaining laws of logic are so modified that the resulting set of laws does the same inferential work as the original set of laws. If L1…Ln are the laws of CL, Ln can be replaced with some other law, provided that compensatory changes are made to L1…Ln-1. What matters is not this or that law, but the structure of the totality of laws; so long as that totality is structured in such a way that it can bear the same inferential burden as some other set of laws, those law-sets are ipso facto of equal value and the viability of this or that specific member of either set cannot be evaluated, except in relation to the value of the totality of which it is a part. So the real laws of logic are not LEM or LEC. The real laws of logic are meta-laws: laws about laws; laws that transform law-sets into different but equally powerful law-sets. When it is said that LEM is false, what is being said, if significant, is that purging the law-set that we use of LEM, but otherwise keeping that law-set unchanged, would yield a more powerful lawset. But a case can be made on the basis of this very point for acceptance of LEM. LEM tells us that, given a sentence-level expression, there are three possibilities:",

One of the virtues of A-B is that, if an assertion occupies some noman’s land between truth and falsehood, that fact needn’t be taken as a primitive, as it can be decomposed into other facts---about its constituentpropositions or about otherwise related propositions. But this is not possible if 1-10 are taken as primitives. Relative to 110, a proposition’s being ‘medium true’ is not capable of analysis: it is the end of the line. So even though 1-10 seems like a more flexible and realistic logic than A-B, it’s the other way around. By reducing primitives to two, as opposed to n>2, A-B gives itself maximal flexibility in respect of its ability to categorize propositions. No viable logic has but one primitive category: there must be at least two. And however many primitive categories there are, they must be mutually exclusive: otherwise they aren’t primitive. But any logic that has n>2 primitive categories i ipso facto excluded from analyzing membership in at least one of those categories into membership in subcategories; and any n-valued logic to that extent lacks the diagnostic flexibility of CL. All of which shows that the laws of logic---the real laws of logic, not the artifacts studied by so-called logicians---are not given by LEM or LNC or Double Negation (p↔¬¬p) but rather by statements to the effect that, given some data-set D=d1…dm, L1…Ln does a better job than some other law-set L*1…L*o of truth-preservingly mapping D-related statements onto Drelated statements. In fact, a bona fide logical law wouldn’t mention L1…Ln or L*1…L*o or any other specific law-set. Nor would it mention d1…dm or indeed any specific statement-set of any kind.

If C1…Cn are the causal properties that x has in virtue of having a certain length, it is no less absurd to distinguish x’s having C1…Cn from its having that length than it is to distinguish an object from the various property-instances associated with it. In fact, the first fallacy is a special case of the second. Diachronic measurement the only kind Seemingly synchronic forms of measurement, e.g. the juxtaposition method of length-determination, collapse into their obviously diachronic counterparts. When you measure X’s length by juxtaposing it with some other object, you are in fact using the optical method. It isn’t that neither of X’s endpoints is a beginning for you; it is that, owing to your large size in relation to X, each such endpoint is a beginning. Optical or otherwise causal methods are always used in measurement. When this appears not to be so, it is because, owing to the smallness relative to the observer of what is being measured, no one metrical determination can be carried out with a plurality of other, result-identical determinations being carried out. Causal properties are change-dispositive properties. For X to have a certain mass or temperature/mass/volume/shape is for it to dispose objects in a certain region to undergo certain kinds of changes, and for X to occupy place p is for p to be the geometrical center of those disturbances.

In fact, it is inherent in the nature of measurement that one’s choice of metrical unit be arbitrary.

In fact, very few systems are complete; and complete systems are so restricted in scope that it is only if embedded in larger, incomplete systems that they are of any use. Object-language vs. meta-language When we talk about a language L, we must use a meta-language. That language may itself be L---as it would be if we were using English to talk about English. But, ultimately, metalanguage and object-language must pull part: No consistent language has the resources to adequately describe its own resources (cf. Tarski—The Concept of Truth in Formal Languages). What we refer to as “English” is a plurality of related languages; and although it is obviously is possible to use English to discuss English, it is possible only by switching from one of those sub-languages to another. Our using English to talk about English involves our actually using some language English2 to talk about English1, where English2 is homonymous in large part with English1, obscuring the fact that different sets of semantic rules, and thus different languages, are involved. Intertranslatibility Two languages L and L* are intertranslatable iff there is a relation R that pairs off each sentence of the one language with a synonymous (meaning-identical) sentence of the other language. Of course, given two natural languages L and L*, any L-sentence is synonymous with many different L*-sentences, and any L*-sentence is synonymous with many different L-sentences. So R is a function, not from sentences to sentences, but from sentence-classes to sentence-classes; and R is therefore one-one, notwithstanding issues relating to ambiguity, intralinguistic redundancy, etc. Productivity and systematicity Any given language is both systematic and productive. “Systematic”: Complex expressions can be permuted to form other complex expressions: “John loves Mary” → “Mary loves John.” Productive: Any expression can be embedded in a larger expression.

(So systematicity is an intensive quality: a language is systematic if it can speak precisely about whatever it is that speak about at all. And productivity is an extensive magnitude: a language is productive if there is much that it can speak about.) Of course, the easy way to add to a language’s expressive capabilities is simply to add more primitive expressions to it. But even though this must be done, it isn’t feasible, even theoretically, unless the new meaning-postulates are absorbed into a pre-existing systematicity- and productivity-conducive structure. A language L is useful to the extent that it can accommodate indefinitely many and many-sorted inferences concerning indefinitely voluminous and heterogeneous data-sets. A language must therefore be able to ‘turn over’, like an engine, an indefinitely large number of times: if, with respect to one class of inferences, it hits a wall after a certain number of rotations, it inevitably hits similar walls with respect to indefinitely many other such classes. It cannot be predetermined how large the expressive/inferential burden of a language will be, and a certain plasticity must therefore be built ab initio into any useful language. Cryptography and language A language is a systematic way of encrypting information; it is a set of functions, which jointly define a single function, from data-sets to statements and vice versa. A translation-manual is a function that pairs off sentences of one language with synonymous sentences of some other language. So translationmanuals define relations of isomorphism between two structures, each of which in its turn defines a relation of isomorphism (between sentences and data-sets). All information-transmission relies on structure-preservation: Structures must physically be preserved if it is to be possible to know about the past or to predict the future (or to make inferences about the nonperceptible present, since doing as much always involves an element of prediction or retrodiction).

In fact, sentences of natural language are categorically context-sensitive. But for expository reasons we are setting this subtlety aside for the moment.

The reason you can compute their meanings is that the meaning of a complex expression is assigned to it by a recursive rule. To compute is to compute the value of a recursive function for a given argument. Thus, in using your knowledge of requisite recursions to identify a complex expression's meaning, you are computing its meaning. The meaning of a complex expression is a function of the meanings of the simple expressions composing it. This is the principle of compositionality. \"Smith's father\" does not have the same meaning as \"Smith's mother,\" for the reason that \"father\" does not have the same meaning as \"mother.\" \"Smith's primary enemy\" does have the same meaning as \"Smith's primary foe,\" for the reason that \"enemy\" does have the same meaning as \"foe.\" Truth-in-L in connection with the concept of incompleteness Truth-in-L cannot be defined in L.

In this respect, English is typical of all natural languages. A natural language is one that comes into existence organically: nobody sits down and invents it; it is the unintentional or semi-intentional by-product of interactions among living creatures (usually, as far as we know, human beings). Artificial languages are languages that are not natural languages. In this paper, an artificial language will be described. That language will also be a formal language. But an artificial language isn't necessarily a formal language. One could invent a language that contained expressions that were not non-contextually unambiguous. (In fact, we will do so ourselves.) People seldom do invent such languages. There are two such reasons, each sociological, as opposed to logical, in nature. (1) First, in some cases people invent languages precisely because they wish to expedite communication in an arena in which contextual-ambiguity is a drawback. (There are many domains of discourse in which the absence of contextualambiguity is a massive hindrance, as we will see, though not in this paper.) Obviously mathematicians don't want the context to determine what is meant by \"+,\" and \"5\" and the like. (2) Second, when languages are invented, it is often to study relations of logical dependence; and given the specific logical relations on which researchers have tended to focus, it is helpful to this end to focus on statement-sets whose elements are unambiguous in every way. But there are logical relations that are not best studied by examining such statement-sets, as semanticists/logicians have come to realize in the last few decades. The difference between a formal and an informal language is that, where informal languages are concerned, the amount of information needed to determine the identity/meaning of a given expression is greater than is the amount of information needed to identify the identity/meaning of an expression of a formal language. Where formal languages are concerned, only one kind of information is needed: morphological information—it must be known what shape the expression has (if it is written) or what sounds like (if it is...",

Nota bene: This last statement is subject to some heavy qualifications First, there are many instances of 12-15 that are false, it being one of the purposes of this paper to identify a class of sentences that invalidate (the likes of) 12-15. For example, \"that guy is identical with that guy,\" which is an instance of the sentence-form \"x=x,\" is false, if, as may well be the case, the first occurrence of \"that guy\" refers to one person and the second refers to some other person. We will find that, given any given one of the sentenceforms typically described as \"laws of logic,\" it is easier to find false instances of that sentence-form than it is find true ones; and we will find some reason to believe that, given any sentence that appears to be a true instance of one of those sentence-forms, careful scrutiny of its syntactic structure indicates that it is not in fact such an instance. That said, there is a large and explanatorily important class of truths any given one of whose members is an instance of 12-15; and it is for that reason that the likes of 12-15 are described as 'logical truths') Second, formal truth is a doubly relative concept. First of all, sentences are not themselves truths or falsehood. When it is said of a sentence that it is true, what is meant is that it expresses a true proposition. The proposition meant by \"snow is white\" is true, and so is the proposition meant by the L-translation, for any language L, of \"snow is white.\" \"Snow is white\" is not identical with \"la neige est blanche\" or \"le nieve es Blanca,' but all three sentences encode the same proposition. So when it is said of a sentence S that it is \"true,\" what is meant is that it expresses a truth, not that it is a truth. When it is said of a proposition P that it is true, what is meant is that it is a truth, not that it expresses a truth.

There are two problems with such a map. First, in order to use such a map, one must be able to have an indexical-thought. If I am to use a map of the world, I must be able to have a correct thought of the form: I am there, where the 'there' corresponds to some particular place on the map. Similarly, if I am to understand non-perspectival utterances, e.g. \"Peter is taller than Mary at 5:53 pm, June 14, 2014,\" I must understand perspectival utterances, e.g. \"Peter is that guy; the present time is 5:53 pm, June 14, 2014.\" In general, non-perspectival information is parasitic on perspectival information: the latter generates the former. And non-perspectival utterances are parasitic on perspectival utterances: the latter generates the former. Science aspires to produce non-perspectival information---and rightly so, since natural laws are mind-independent. But scientific (nonperspectival) knowledge is painstakingly extracted from perspectival knowledge, and there is no way to acquire scientific knowledge except on the basis of perspectival knowledge. Consequently, there is no way to articulate science-critical data except on the basis of perspectival language and a fortiori no way to articulate the hypotheses that model that data. Why indexical-free languages cannot express perspectival information (continued) Also, the mind falls within the scope of science, and the same is therefore true of the subjective and the perspectival. It is a fact that perspectives exist, and science must model data-sets whose elements are perspectival perceptions and thoughts.

As advocates of this view know full well, not all meaning-postulates assign theory-constitutive propositions to sentence-schemata.

If K satisfies these two conditions, every computationally relevant fact about any given one of its members can be represented by marks on a Turing-tape, and a suitably programmed Turing machine can therefore respond appropriately to those marks. A Turing-unsolvable Problem Turing proved that not every problem is Turing-solvable. Consider the question: (T) Is every problem Turing-solvable? For argument’s sake, suppose the answer to be “yes.” In that case, there is a program P, capable of being run on a Turing Machine, having the following property: Given any program F and given any input I, P can determine whether a Turing Machine running F will “halt” if given input I. Given the existence of P, it follows that there exists a program Q such that, for any program F, Q can determine whether or not F halts if F runs F itself.

Case Number 1: Suppose that, according to Q, R halts if R runs itself. In that case, by (1), R runs forever. Case Number 2: Suppose that, according to Q, R runs forever if R runs itself. In that case, by (2) R halts. In the first case, R runs forever if R halts. In the second, R halts if R runs forever. Thus, if R runs on itself, it halts if, and only if, it does not halt. Since this is not possible, there cannot be such a program as R. Since R exists if Q exists, Q does not exist; and since Q exists if P exists, P does not exist. There is thus no way to compute the solution to the “Halting Problem.” This does not mean that there is no way to solve that problem, only that there is no mechanical way to do so. Part 2: Philosophical Implications A computer is, by definition, a mechanical problem-solver. To say that a problem can be solved mechanically is to say that no thought is needed to solve it. Thus, if a computer can do it, thought is not required to do it. Mechanical problem-solvers are not thinkers; they are thinker- proxies. “But if computers don’t think,” it will be objected, “then they don’t solve problems.” Computers don’t think, and they don’t solve problems. A mechanical ‘problem-solver’ is a non-problem-solver whose behavior makes it easy for an intelligent observe to solve otherwise difficult problems. Suppose that 3+5= is entered into a properly functioning calculating device. That device is so structured that, on the basis of the physical characteristics of that input, it outputs 8. If it were on the basis of the meaning of that input that it decided what to output, it wouldn’t be a calculating device at all. By the same token, since it is a device, it is blind to the meaning of both input and output. Therefore, it cannot possibly be aware of the fact that the output was meaning- appropriate to the input, and it therefore has not in any literal sense solved anything. What it has done is make it easier for someone who does understand input and output to solve the problem in...",

How to solve this paradox? Eugene Mills’ solution to Zeno’s paradox For any possible universe U, there is some distance D such that nothing in U can move at all without covering a distance of at least D. Explanation: Zeno has established that if any given motion presupposes another motion, then nothing can even begin to leave the place that it is occupying at a given time. Therefore, (i) must be rejected. Assuming that (i) is false, it is not possible for there to no minimum, short of nullity, to the amount by which a given object moves. Therefore, in any world where motion is possible, there is some finite distance such that anything that moves in that world moves by at least that distance. Problems with Mills’ solution If Mills is right, then any given universe U consists of discrete cells such that, for any occupant x of U, x moves by vanishing from one cell and then appearing in another. x cannot move from one cell to the next, since there would in that case not be a minimum distance that x had to travel in order to travel at all. A consequence of Mills’ position is that nothing moves. The assertion that",

If you are obliterated and some person who is exactly like you appears a moment later right next to where you were standing, that person isn’t you. Let you2 be that person. Given that you2 came into existence spontaneously, there are no lines of transmission linking him to the past and thus no lines of transmission linking you2 to you. Therefore, you2 is not you; and youn (n>2) isn’t identical with either you or with youi (1≤i<n). If n is a sufficiently high number and there is a sufficiently small delay between youi’s disappearance and youi+1’s appearance, it will certainly appear that you had moved from one place to another. But that is obviously irrelevant. In a Mills-universe, nothing has a past and, therefore, nothing has a future. Everything that exists, exists for an instant and then vanishes. There is no possibility of mutual causal influence among the occupants of a Millsuniverse. Such a universe is no universe at all, since any given occupant of such a universe is in the very condition that it would be in if it were in a universe all by itself. Therefore, a Mills-universe is a non-universe. Also, relative spatial and temporal position are to be understood in causal terms. Events are simultaneous if neither can affect the other; otherwise non-simultaneous. Since there is no causation in a given Milluniverse U, no U-occupant x can have either a spatial or a temporal position relative to any other U-occupant y. Thus, a Mills-universe is one in which there are neither places nor times. In conclusion, Mills has given us a heap of absurdities, not a solution. Bertrand Russell’s solution to Zeno’s paradox The sum of infinitely many positive numbers may be finite (e.g. 1+½ +¼+…=2), and any finite number can be represented as such a sum. Therefore, the sum of infinitely many non-null motions may be a finite motion, and any given finite motion can be represented as such a sum.

Chapter 17 The Coin Paradox (2015) There are infinitely many quarter-sized regions on a flat table-top. Thus, if N is the exact number of quarter-sized regions, then, given any specific quarter-sized region, there is a 1/N=0 chance that a quarter dropped on that surface will occupy that exact region. But there is some quarter-sized region R that the quarter will come to occupy. Thus, there is 0% chance that the quarter will occupy R, and yet the quarter occupies R. In this context, N is aleph-one, this being the number of real numbers, which is also the number of distinct subregions of a surface. The solution: 1/N≠0/N. To say that there is a 1/N chance that the quarter will occupy R is to say that the likelihood of its doing so is minimal but not nil. In general, p(e) is minimal if equal to 1/N, and nil if equal to 0/N, where p(e) is the probability of e. Probabilities are given by real numbers, not by cardinal numbers. Real numbers are limits.

The sentence: (BW) “Bill’s whereabouts are indeterminate,” can be taken to mean either: (BW1) given the available information, it isn’t possible to arrive at a principled judgment as to where Bill is. or (BW2) there is no fact as to where Bill is. BW2 cannot possibly be true. At any given point in time, there some space-time region R is such that Bill is occupying R. Of course, half of Bill's body can be in the garage while the other half is in the drive way. But that’s because the region he is occupying is itself half in the garage and half in the driveway; it is not because there is no region that Bill is determinately occupying. The same points mutatis mutandis hold of any other proposition to the effect that the world per se is indeterminate in any respect. In any case, this is what the present author believes. But many disagree, and their reasons for doing so initially seem to be good ones. For there certainly seem to be cases of objects with vague boundaries. In fact, all spatiotemporal objects, it would seem, have vague boundaries. Given any person P, there are many particles x such that one cannot non-arbitrarily say that ‹x is a part P's body› is true or that it's not true.

Surely, the occurrence of “smart” in (i) has the same meaning (picks out the same property) as the homonymous expression in (ii). This wouldn’t be possible if, in (i), the occurrence of “smart” picked out a binary (nonrelational) property. This shows that “smart” is always relational. This, in its turn, shows that tokens of (i) are elliptical for sentence-tokens that expressrelational propositions---sentence-tokens having the form: (i#) “Smith is smarter than___,” or perhaps: (i*) “Smith is smart enough for__.” So tokens of “Smith is smart” must be elliptical for sentences such as “Smith is smarter than Jones” and “Smith is smart enough to solve the puzzle.” Exactly similar points hold of other non-binary predicates. The meaning of “x is fast” is given by some sentence having the form “x is faster than y” (e.g., “Smith is faster than Jones”) or having the form “x is fast enough to satisfy standard S” (e.g., “that plane is fast enough to make it to Pittsburgh by 3:00 P.M.\"). A confusion side-stepped Here I would like to head off a source of serious confusion. I am not advocating the view that at the level of semantics “Smith is smart,\" “Jones is tall,\" etc. express relational propositions of the just-mentioned kind. It cannot be assumed that the philosophical insights needed to solve puzzles that turn on facts about language are themselves encoded in the semantic rules of English (or of whatever language happens to be the relevant one). So the juststated analysis is not a semantic analysis; it is not an attempt to identify the semantic rules that assign meaning to sentences of the form “x is P,\" where P is an arbitrary non-binary predicate. It makes no sense to say that some number is more even than some other number. But this has nothing to do with language; it has to do with the property of being even. The sentence “6 is more even than 8,\" though absurd, does not run afoul of the semantic (or syntactic) rules of English. (Or, if it does, it is only because we have ex post facto projected our mathematical insights into syntactico-semantic rules of English.

A third kind of Sorites Paradox Let us now discuss, and attempt to solve, the so-called “Paradox of the Heap.”[19] Here is that paradox: P3: A single grain of sand is not a heap of sand. If n grains of sand don’t jointly constitute a heap, then neither do n + 1 grains of sand. In other words, adding a grain of sand to a non-heap won’t yield a heap. Therefore, a billion grains of sand don’t constitute a heap. As it stands, P3 isn’t really a paradox. First of all, a billion grains of sand, even when taken jointly, don’t necessarily constitute a heap. If a million grains of sand are dispersed through space---if they are ‘scattered’---they don’t constitute a heap. So for a given multiplicity of grains of sand to constitute a heap, any given grain must be (relatively[20]) contiguous with at least one other member of that multiplicity. But even though, for a multiplicity of grains of sand to form a heap, it is necessary that they fulfill that condition, it isn’t sufficient. For a billion grains of sand that are arranged in a straight line, each contiguous with its neighbors (or, if it’s the first or last grain, with its one neighbor) isn’t a heap. For a multiplicity of grains of sand to qualify as a heap, it is necessary and (ultimately) sufficient that they satisfy the following requirements:",

A sand-castle is not a heap of sand. What is the relevant difference? “Sandcastles are products of human artifice, whereas heaps of sand are not.” First of all, heaps of sand are often products of human artifice; second of all, there are structures (e.g., plants) that are not the products of artifice that are definitely heaps and wouldn’t be heaps if, other things being equal, they were made of sand. The difference between a heap of sand and a sand-castle seems to lie in the fact that there are quite strict conditions that a grain of sand must satisfy to become part of a sand-castle, whereas there are no conditions, apart from some very generic ones, that a grain of sand must satisfy to become part of a heap of sand. To become part of a given sandcastle, a given grain of sand must be affixed to the sand-castle in such a way that it either (a) provides extra support for the walkway connecting the two towers or (b) completes some otherwise incomplete decoration on the castle, etc. But to become part of a heap of sand, a given grain of sand need only be adjacent with one or more of that heap’s existing constituents. These points make it clear how to solve a paradox that is similar to P3 and that is to be solved in much the same way: (P3#) A single grain of sand is not a heap. If n grains of sand, no matter how they are arranged, don’t jointly constitute a heap, then adding another grain to those grains won’t yield a heap, no matter how that extra grain is added to that heap. What makes it seem that (P3#) is hard to solve is that the word “heap” hasn’t been defined. I don’t mean that it hasn’t been precisified[21], but that it hasn’t been disambiguated. If a “heap” refers to a structure, as opposed to an amorphous mound, of a certain kind, then, depending on what sort of structure that is, adding one more grain of sand to a structure consisting of n grains of sand quite definitely will turn a non-heap into a heap.

Moreover, C ‘dominates’ each of A and B in a way suggestively similar to the way in which 1 dominates its constituents. A’s being instantiated is necessary but not sufficient for C’s being instantiated, the same being true of B’s being instantiated. Tommy’s existing is necessary but not sufficient for 1’s being true, the same being true of somebody’s being a smoker. While none of this demonstrates definitively that 1 is identical with S or that 1’s being true is identical with S’s being instantiated, we have, I believe, found enough of a match between 1/1’s being true and S/S’s members’ being instantiated to warrant looking into the idea that they might be one and the same. 2.0 The unity of the proposition How does 1 combine Tommy with the property of smoking? According to Frege, Tommy (or some concept thereof) saturates that property (or some concept thereof). (Henceforth, I’ll omit the qualification ‘or some concept thereof.’) But this doesn’t help at all. For, as Davidson (1967) observed, the term “saturate” is just another label for the operation in question. So while the Fregean statement: (FR) “1 is the result of Tommy’s saturating the concept of smoking,” may well be correct, we don’t know what it means. We are in a position to give the meaning of FR and to say what this mysterious ‘saturating’ amounts to. We’ve argued that 1 is a set whose members include the property of being Tommy, the property of smoking, and the property of being a...",

It immediately implies: i Tommy smokes; ii something smokes; iii Tommy does something; iv Tommy exists; v something does something. Indeed, 1 implies (i)-(v) in a manner that is naturally described as formal. (So, granting that the term “form”---as in “formal” entailment”--typically describes a property of expressions, we have, it seems, identified a propositional analogue of that property.) And 2 immediately implies: i* Tommy snores; ii* something snores; iii Tommy does something; iv Tommy exists; v something does something. Now let’s look at S and at S*. The members of S are:",

    "text": "* The property of being a something that does something. Having identified 1 with S and 2 with S*, everything we know about those propositions – about what they entail, about what their components are, and about how their higher-level components are “forged” out of their lower level components – is accounted for. 4.0 Another desideratum satisfied by this analysis Many semanticists today hold that Plato and Socrates are veritable objects are constituents of propositions that concern them. So according to Kaplan (1989), who is following and agreeing with Russell (1903), Tommy – the person, not some Fregean concept thereof – is a constituent of both 1 and 2. Other adherents of this view are Scott Soames (2003), Nathan Salmon (2005), and Robert Moore (1995). (Opponents are J. Searle (1983), M. Dummett (1973), and – with some very heavy reservations to be stated later – the present author.) There is a rather serious problem with this view. Consider, not 1 or 2, but rather: 3. Plato snores. At this point in time, Plato doesn’t exist. So if he’s a (necessary[25]) constituent of 3 – if, in other words, 3 exists only if Plato does---then 3 doesn’t exist. Salmon and Soames, both of them hardline direct referencetheorists, deal with this by taking a desperate measure, viz., by saying that 3 exists and that its existence constitutively depends on Plato’s existence and that these two positions can be reconciled with each other --- that, more specifically, they can be reconciled by saying that 3 exists, albeit as a nonexistent proposition. This is not necessary or plausible or helpful. 3 exists. Plato does not. But the property of being identical with Plato, whatever it is, does exist. What is it to be Plato? To be Plato is, perhaps, to be a causal sequence that is initiated by the fertilizing of a certain egg by a certain spermatozoa. To be Plato is, perhaps, to have a soul or mind of a certain kind. What we know is that, if something is Plato, it’s being Plato supervenes on something probably having to do with the mass-energy distribution in the cosmos – on its mode of origination, on the quotient of spiritual energy in the particle-interactions that constitute it, on who knows what. In any case, even though Plato does not exist, the property of being identical with Plato does. That’s why I can meaningfully, not...",

It is readily seen that, on our analysis, there is some x, such that x is Plato and such that 3 is true exactly if x snores, it being irrelevant what other properties x has. This is exactly what the direct-referentialist holds. At the same time, our analysis guarantees the existence of the proposition that Plato snores -- after all, the property of being Plato exists, even though it is now uninstantiated. So our analysis of Plato snores gives the direct-referencetheorist the truth-conditions that he wants and that (given certain compelling arguments due to Kripke, 1980; and Soames, 2003, 2004) he deserves. At the same time, our analysis doesn’t put the direct-reference-theorist in the awkward, logic-bending position of having to say that the proposition that Plato snores exists despite the failure of existence of entities on whose existence its own existence is constitutively dependent.[26]",

    "text": "* [I am not sure about the following point, that being why I amputting it in a footnote.] Another consequence of TT, and of (iii) in particular, is that it cannot meaningfully be said that the cardinality of the continuum is greater than that of the cardinals. Cardinal numbers are classes of classes. Rationals are ordered pairs (two-membered classes) of cardinals, and therefore classes of classes of classes. Reals are classes of rationals, and therefore classes of classes of classes of classes. Let P be the property of having the cardinality of the class of real numbers or, equivalently, the classes of all classes having the same cardinality as the class of real numbers. Being a property/class of classes of classes of classes of classes, P is a fifth-level property/class. Therefore, if \"n\" is any number-expression such that \"the class of reals has n members,\" then \"the class of cardinals has n members\" is meaningless (neither true nor false), for the same reason that, given TT, \"I 31 have pairs of shoes\" is meaningless. [3] I.e. what we have is a case of a Moore-paradox. If say \"nobody ever says anything,\" what I am saying---the proposition that I am affirming—is: P: No one ever says anything. P could obviously be true. It was true in our world before language was invented. P is obviously inconsistent with the supposition that: P*: Somebody says P. But P doesn't entail P*, and P doesn't otherwise self-refute. If I say \"snow is white, but I don't believe that snow is white,\" what I am saying—the proposition I am affirming---is: Q: snow is white, and I don't believe that snow is white, which could obviously be true. (When I was six weeks old, each conjunct was true.) Q is inconsistent with the supposition that Q*: I sincerely utter (and therefore believe) that snow is white; and snow is white; and I don't believe that snow is white. But Q doesn't entail Q*, and Q doesn't otherwise self-refute. .",
