## WORK-001: BEYOND THE PLEASURE PRINCIPLE (1920) - 170 POSITIONS

### PHILOSOPHY OF MIND / PSYCHOLOGY
1. Mental processes automatically regulated by pleasure-principle (tension reduction)
2. Complete theory requires topographical, dynamic, AND economic elements (metapsychology)
3. Rate of excitation change more important than absolute quantity for feeling
4. Fechner: pleasure/pain relate to stability/instability conditions (equilibrium theory)
5. Psychic apparatus keeps excitation low/constant (constancy principle)
6. Pleasure-principle has limited not absolute supremacy (opposed by other forces)
7. Reality-principle replaces pleasure-principle for adaptation (postponement, renunciation)
8. Repression during development creates neurotic pain = "pleasure cannot be experienced"
9. Most pain is perceptual: unsatisfied instincts OR external danger stimuli

### THEORY OF TRAUMA AND NEUROSIS
10. Traumatic neurosis from severe shock with life danger (not just organic injury)
11. Fright/Fear/Apprehension are distinct: Fright = unprepared encounter with danger
12. Apprehension protects against trauma (preparation prevents fright-neurosis)
13. Traumatic dreams violate wish-fulfillment (attempt retroactive apprehension development)
14. Child's fort-da game repeats unpleasant separation for mastery
15. Play transforms passivity to activity (child applies unpleasant to playfellow)
16. Patient repeats rather than remembers (transference as compulsion sphere)
17. Transference-neurosis replaces earlier neurosis in treatment
18. Resistance from ego not from repressed (unconscious strives toward consciousness)
19. Repetition-compulsion revives experiences with no pleasure potential
20. Normal life shows repetition-compulsion (pursuing fate, daemonic destiny)
21. Active vs passive repetition (character trait vs seeming passivity)
22. Repetition-compulsion real existence beyond pleasure-principle established

### INSTINCT THEORY AND DEATH DRIVE
23. Consciousness not universal characteristic but special boundary function
24. Consciousness and memory-trace incompatible in same system
25. System Bw characteristics from exposed position (immediate external contact)
26. Living vesicle surface differentiated by position ("burned rind" for reception)
27. Protection against stimuli more important than reception
28. Unconscious processes "timeless" (not chronological)
29. Inner excitations bypass protective barrier (no internal protection)
30. Projection origin: treating painful inner as if external (defensive externalization)
31. Trauma = excitations breaking through barrier (relationship to efficacious barrier)
32. Binding traumatic stimuli: converting free-flowing to quiescent energy
33. Counter-charge mechanism around breach (impoverishing other systems)
34. Binding force proportionate to quiescent charge level
35. Free-flowing vs quiescent energy distinction (Breuer) fundamental to metapsychology
36. Traumatic neurosis as barrier rupture (old "shock" theory rehabilitated)
37. Fright = failure of apprehension/preparation mechanism
38. Traumatic dreams re-establish preparation retroactively (not wish-fulfillment)
39. First exception to dream wish-fulfillment principle (traumatic/childhood trauma dreams)
40. Dreams may have prehistoric past function before wish-fulfillment
41. Instinct = conservative tendency toward reinstatement of earlier condition
42. Animal behavior evidence: migration, spawning journeys to earlier homes
43. Embryonic development repeats ancestral forms (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny)
44. Regeneration demonstrates conservative organic tendency
45. All instincts aim at earlier condition (development from external forces only)
46. Evolution result of external forces (conservative instincts store enforced changes)
47. **"The goal of all life is death"** - return to inorganic starting point
48. Life origin: properties awakened in lifeless matter (baffling force created tension)
49. First instinct = return to lifelessness (death drive most primitive)
50. Circuitous routes to death = phenomena of life (external forces compelled detours)
51. Self-preservation instincts = part-instincts securing peculiar death path
52. Organism dies only its own way (watchmen of life = myrmidons of death)
53. Sexual instincts exception (not all organisms developed; many stayed primitive)
54. Reproductive cells retain original structure (detach charged with dispositions)
55. Germ cells operate against death (potential immortality through regeneration)
56. Fortification through mingling (sexual union essential for life function)
57. Sexual instincts specially conservative (resistant, preserve life longer = life-instincts)
58. Contradiction between life/death instincts (oscillating rhythm in organisms)
59. Sexuality not at dawn of life but opposition to ego-instincts may have been
60. No general impulse toward higher development (no examples counter to conservative)
61. Higher development often balanced by retrogression (relative valuation)
62. No impulse toward perfection in man (reject superman concept)
63. Striving for perfection = repression effect (culture built on repression)
64. Excess demand over satisfaction creates driving momentum (Mephisto: "urges ever forward")
65. Path back barred by repression (forward movement = failed regression)
66. Perfection impulse not universal (minority phenomenon, rare economic conditions)
67. Sharp antithesis: ego-instincts (death) vs sexual instincts (life)
68. Ego-instincts from vitalizing inanimate matter (aim = lifelessness reinstatement)
69. Sexual union as condition for immortality (germ cell death without it)
70. What does sexual reproduction repeat? (Unanswered; would relieve if theory wrong)
71. Testing natural death assumption (made light-heartedly, consolatory belief)
72. Natural death may be illusion (alien to primitive races = enemy/spirit attribution)
73. Little biological agreement on death (conception eludes biologists)
74. Weismann: mortal soma vs immortal germ-plasm distinction
75. Weismann's differentiation only for multicellular (unicellular = immortal)
76. Death as purposive contrivance for multicellular (adaptation not necessity)
77. Death became possible/expedient with soma/germ-plasm differentiation
78. Propagation not introduced with death (primordial like growth)
79. Late death doesn't help death instinct theory (would undermine it)
80. Debate over Weismann not decisive (multiple conflicting views)
81. Protozoa subject to death (coincides with propagation but disguised)
82. Woodruff: slipper-animalcule to 3029th generation (immortality experiment)
83. Contradictory findings: Maupas/Calkins found aging/death in infusoria
84. Conjugation prevents aging (rejuvenation through mingling)
85. Invigorating influence replaceable (chemical/mechanical stimuli work too)
86. Infusoria die from own metabolic products (natural death mechanism)
87. Own products fatal but not related species products (proved convincingly)
88. All higher animals die from metabolic product disposal inability
89. Doubt about studying death in protozoa (primitive organization may conceal)
90. Dynamic vs morphological viewpoint shift (indifferent if protozoa death proved)
91. Death-instincts may be active from beginning (obscured by life forces)
92. Even protozoa immortality doesn't invalidate hypothesis (manifestation vs process)
93. Weismann distinction/death-life instinct distinction resemblance unshaken
94. Hering: anabolic vs katabolic processes = our two instinctive tendencies?
95. Convergence with Schopenhauer (death = real result; sex = will to live)
96. Multicellularity as life-prolongation means (one cell helps preserve others)
97. Conjugation has preservative/rejuvenating effect (prototype for sexual effect)
98. Libido theory applied to cells (sexual instincts in each cell neutralize death-instincts)
99. Germ cells behave narcissistically (concentrate libido on self for later construction)
100. Malignant growths as narcissistic (pathology sees embryonal attributes)

### LIBIDO THEORY DEVELOPMENT
101. Initial opposition: sexual vs ego-instincts (transference-neuroses analysis)
102. Psychoanalysis adhered to "hunger and love" distinction
103. Extension of sexuality concept (beyond propagation function)
104. Psychoanalysis approached psychological ego (repressing/censoring agency)
105. Objections to narrow libido concept (critics lacked alternative)
106. Libido withdrawn from object to ego (introversion observation)
107. Ego as sexual object (choicest among them)
108. Narcissistic libido = sexual instinct energy (identified with self-preservation)
109. Part of ego-instincts recognized as libidinous
110. Difference now topographical not qualitative (ego vs object investment)
111. Accentuating libidinous character of self-preservation instincts
112. Risk of having only libidinous instincts (critics right about pansexualism?)
113. Result not intended (started with sharp ego/sexual distinction)
114. Dualistic standpoint maintained (life vs death instincts now)
115. Jung's monistic confusion (libido = all instinctive energy)
116. Analysis of ego progress insufficient (hard to demonstrate other instincts)
117. Narcissism conjecture already present (ego-instincts drew libidinous components)
118. Analysis only demonstrates libidinous impulses (doesn't prove no others)
119. New polarity: love (tenderness) vs hate (aggression)
120. Sadism as death-instinct component (long recognized in sexuality)
121. Sadism derived from death-instinct (driven from ego by narcissistic libido)
122. Sadism's progressive role in sexuality (oral→separation→genital primacy)
123. Hate-love ambivalence setup (where sadism experiences no fusion)
124. Masochism as return to earlier phase (recoil of sadism onto ego)
125. Masochism may be primary (correction of earlier denial)
126. Conjugation effect as prototype (strengthening/rejuvenating in protozoa)
127. Blending introduces new stimulus masses (life renewal mechanism)
128. Union increases chemical tensions (life process otherwise equalizes to death)
129. Nirvana-principle recognition (struggle for stimulus tension removal)
130. Sexual instinct lacks repetition-compulsion character (disturbing for theory)
131. Germ cells as repetitions (sexual propagation repeats organic beginning)
132. Must enquire into sexual propagation origin (lay mind quails, specialists unsolved)
133. Sex as advantageous amphimixis utilization (Darwinian view)
134. Amphimixis from fortuitous conjugation (sex not ancient; repeat what chanced)
135. Same question recurs for sex as for death (crediting protozoa with more)
136. Objection: presupposes life-instincts from beginning (conjugation retained/elaborated)
137. Working with two unknown quantities (sex origin obscure as death)
138. Plato's Aristophanes myth (fantastic but fulfills one condition)
139. Plato's three original sexes (third had equal share in male/female)
140. Zeus divided original beings (longing for other half, desired to grow together)
141. Daring assumption of original rent (living substance split, strives for reunion)
142. Sexual instincts continue chemical affinity (from inanimate matter)
143. Dispersed fragments achieve multicellular organization (transfer reunion instinct to germ cells)

### EPISTEMOLOGY & METHODOLOGY
144. Uncertainty about personal conviction (neither convinced nor seeking conviction)
145. Following thought as scientific curiosity (advocatus diaboli permissible)
146. Third step less certain than first two (sexuality extension/narcissism more solid)
147. Regressive instinct character based on observation (repetition-compulsion facts)
148. Departing far from observation (combining facts with imagination repeatedly)
149. Distrust of intuition (impartiality of intellect rare on ultimate questions)
150. Deep-rooted preferences control speculation (unwittingly playing into their hands)
151. Self-criticism doesn't require tolerance (reject contradicted theories; know own tentative)
152. No disturbance from surprising processes (instinct expelled, turning, etc. expected from metaphor)
153. Obliged to use metaphorical language (psychology of deeper layers requires it)
154. Psychological terms are metaphors (like physiological/chemical would be)
155. Biology may overthrow hypothesis structure (limitless possibilities expected)
156. Perhaps overthrow whole structure (someone may ask why communicate it then)

### FUNCTION AND TENDENCY
157. Distinguish function from tendency (pleasure-principle = tendency serving function)
158. Cannot yet decide between conceptions (eliminate excitation vs keep constant/low)
159. Greatest pleasure in temporary quenching (sexual climax as paradigm)
160. Bound vs unbound processes and sensation (unbound = more intense both directions)
161. Primary processes earlier in time (beginning of mental life)
162. Search for pleasure more intense at beginning (but less unrestrictedly)
163. Dominance more assured at maturity (though still limited)
164. Further studies required on tension (tension may be pleasurable or painful itself)
165. Questions about bound/unbound and tension (sensation correlates unclear)
166. Life-instincts appear as disturbers (make appearance, bring tension states)
167. Death-instincts function unostentatiously (pleasure-principle serves death)
168. Innumerable questions without answers (must be patient, ready to abandon path)
169. Only true believers expect science as creed substitute (others take amiss theory development)
170. Consolation in slow scientific progress ("limping is no sin")
