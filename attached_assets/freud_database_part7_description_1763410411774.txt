NOTABLE POSITIONS
----------------

Metapsychological:
- FREUD-0545: Repression creates the unconscious; what is repressed remains active, constantly striving for expression
- FREUD-0562: The unconscious is truly real psychical reality, unknown to us as external world
- FREUD-0567: Same force that now as resistance opposes forgotten material's emergence formerly brought about forgetting (repression)

Clinical:
- FREUD-0517: Hans confirms Oedipus complex in most concrete manner - little Oedipus wanting father out of way
- FREUD-0531: Hysterical patients suffer from reminiscences; symptoms are mnemic symbols of traumatic experiences
- FREUD-0521: Obsessional neurotic's uncertainty and doubt is expression of inner battle between love and hate

Developmental:
- FREUD-0577: The death of the father is most important event and most poignant loss in man's life
- FREUD-0586: Narcissism is essential stage when child takes own body as love-object before turning to external objects
- FREUD-0602: Latency period where sexual impulses undergo repression, reaction-formation, sublimation

Sexuality & Love:
- FREUD-0537: Universal tendency to debasement results from difficulty uniting affectionate and sensual currents
- FREUD-0592: Penis envy in girls is counterpart to castration complex in boys, profoundly affecting feminine development
- FREUD-0519: Homosexuality results from intense mother attachment, boy identifying with mother

Cultural:
- FREUD-0525: Modern civilization requires extraordinary sexual repression, depleting energy for civilized activity
- FREUD-0601: Civilization built upon suppression of instincts, but excessive suppression extracts too high price
- FREUD-0612: Religious practices and obsessional ceremonials are analogous; obsessional neurosis is private religion

Therapeutic:
- FREUD-0563: Transference develops without physician intervention, consisting of intense emotional relations repeated from infancy
- FREUD-0584: Counter-transference arises from patient's influence on physician's unconscious; must be overcome through self-analysis
- FREUD-0598: Interpretation must proceed gradually from surface to depth; premature interpretation provokes resistance

Creative/Cultural:
- FREUD-0480: Creative writers are valuable allies, drawing upon sources of mind knowledge that science hasn't accessed
- FREUD-0534: Artistic creation parallels neurotic symptom formation; artist molds phantasies into new reality
- FREUD-0494: Child at play behaves like creative writer, creating world invested with emotion while distinguishing from reality

THEORETICAL SIGNIFICANCE
-----------------------

Part 7 represents a crucial period in psychoanalytic development (1906-1918):
