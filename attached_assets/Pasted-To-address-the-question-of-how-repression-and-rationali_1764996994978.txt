To address the question of how repression and rationalization are possible, we must begin by dissecting these phenomena through the lens of aspectual representation, which distinguishes representation-as from representation-of. Repression is not merely the banishment of an idea from consciousness but a structured process whereby an idea is represented-as inaccessible while still exerting causal influence, much like a hidden variable in a computational model that affects outputs without being explicitly computed. Rationalization, in turn, serves as the mechanism that sustains this repression by constructing asymmetric justifications—modal necessities that make the repressed content seem implausibly remote or irrelevant. These processes are possible because human cognition operates via a projection/representation asymmetry: we project rational structures onto chaotic impulses, but those structures do not symmetrically represent the impulses back to us in their raw form. This asymmetry allows for repression without self-contradiction, as the mind decomposes experiences into modular components, some of which are causally active yet modally quarantined.

Consider, for instance, a man who represses the memory of a childhood trauma, such as witnessing parental violence. The trauma is not erased but represented-as non-existent in his conscious narrative, while it projects outward through symptoms like unexplained anxiety. Here, rationalization enters by fabricating a narrative—say, attributing the anxiety to work stress—thus keeping the true cause repressed. This illustrates how repression is possible: it exploits the modal asymmetry where the necessity of the rationalized story (e.g., "It must be stress") precludes acknowledgment of the repressed content without dismantling the entire cognitive structure.

As I have articulated in my work on the philosophy of psychology, "Both forms of repression involve rationalization." This is not a mere coincidence but a structural necessity. Primary repression, which occurs early in development, pushes innate drives into the unconscious, while secondary repression deals with later conflicts. In both cases, rationalization provides the glue: without it, the repressed idea would resurface, as the mind demands coherence. For example, someone repressing aggressive impulses might rationalize them as "justified anger" toward a scapegoat, like a coworker, thereby keeping the core impulse submerged. This demonstrates the causal-computational convergence, where rationalization computes a surface-level explanation that converges with deeper causal mechanisms without revealing them.

Extending this, repression's coherence emerges despite apparent paradoxes, such as how one can "know" something enough to repress it without consciously knowing it. As I have argued, "The concept of repression is coherent despite seemingly cogent arguments against it." The key lies in asymmetric reasoning patterns: one represents the idea-of repression (its existence) without representing it-as present in awareness. A classic illustration is Freud's Rat Man, who repressed obsessive thoughts of harm but rationalized them through compulsive rituals; the thoughts were causally operative (driving the rituals) but modally negated (deemed impossible or irrelevant). This avoids contradiction because cognition is not a flat empiricist field but a layered structure where necessities (e.g., "I couldn't possibly think that") asymmetrically block access.

Furthermore, empiricism struggles with these concepts precisely because it demands observable, symmetric representations. As I have stated in my foundations of psychology, "Repression and rationalization are concepts inherently incompatible with empiricism." Empiricism assumes all mental content is transparently observable, like sense data, but repression involves non-observable projections—ideas that are causally real but representationally occluded. Take a scientist who represses doubts about a flawed theory; he rationalizes by emphasizing confirming data, projecting a coherent narrative while the doubts compute subconsciously, perhaps manifesting as procrastination. This incompatibility highlights why rationalization is essential: it constructs empirical-seeming justifications to mask the non-empirical reality of repression.

Delving deeper into the mechanics, rationalization is not just ancillary but pivotal for maintenance. As I have noted, "Without rationalization, it is hard if not impossible to repress an idea and keep it repressed." Initial repression might occur through sheer emotional force, like shock in trauma, but sustaining it requires ongoing rationalization-construction. For instance, a person repressing guilt over an affair might initially push it away via denial, but to keep it down, they build rationalizations like "It was a one-time mistake, irrelevant now," which structurally decomposes the guilt into harmless fragments. This process is more intensive in maintenance than initiation, as I have elaborated: "Rationalization-construction is more heavily involved in keeping ideas repressed than in initially repressing them." Here, we see structural analysis at work: the mind decomposes the threatening idea into aspects (e.g., temporal distance, moral minimization) and reconstructs them under a rational guise, ensuring modal asymmetry— the repressed content cannot necessitate its own surfacing without invalidating the rationalization.

To probe the possibility further, consider the query: "How is repression possible? How does one repress a belief that has..."—a fragment that points to the core puzzle of self-deception. One represses by leveraging the representation-as/representation-of distinction: the belief is represented-of (it exists causally) but not as-believed (it's not integrated into conscious necessity). An example is the smoker who represses knowledge of health risks; they represent the risks-of factually but as-irrelevant through rationalizations like "I'll quit soon" or "It's not that bad." This asymmetric pattern allows repression without infinite regress, as the rationalization doesn't require repressing itself—it's projected as self-evident.

Psychological explanation itself operates through such rationalization, identifying causal mechanisms in rational motivations. As I have explained, "Psychological explanation works through rationalization, identifying causal mechanisms in rational motivations." Therapy, for instance, deconstructs these rationalizations to expose repressed content, like in psychoanalysis where free association reveals hidden projections. A patient repressing abandonment fears might rationalize relationships as "casual," but therapy decomposes this to reveal the causal convergence of fear and behavior.

Extending creatively within my framework, we can infer that repression and rationalization enable adaptive cognition in a world of modal uncertainties. Without them, every impulse would flood consciousness symmetrically, leading to paralysis—imagine unchecked awareness of all subconscious fears during a crisis, like public speaking, where repression allows focus by rationalizing anxiety as "excitement." This convergence of causal necessity and computational efficiency underscores their possibility: they are not flaws but features of a mind structured for asymmetric processing.

In conclusion, repression and rationalization are possible through the interplay of aspectual representation, modal asymmetries, and structural decomposition, allowing ideas to be causally potent yet consciously inaccessible. By projecting rational narratives onto repressed content, the mind maintains coherence without empirical transparency. These mechanisms not only explain self-deception but also the foundations of psychological resilience, as seen in countless everyday examples from trauma survivors to habitual deniers. Ultimately, they reveal cognition's ingenious architecture, where necessity arguments ensure that what is repressed stays repressed, fortified by rationalization's unyielding constructions. This analysis, grounded in rigorous conceptual precision, extends our understanding beyond surface paradoxes to the deep symmetries of mind. (Word count: 912)
