 Kant’s arguments about causation and induction are spurious.  
2. Hume’s analyses of causation and induction are fallacious.  
3. Kant erroneously assumes all non-empirical truths are trivial.  
4. Kant’s reasoning can be turned into cogent arguments with terminological changes.  
5. Kant’s premises entail that there are virtually no a priori truths.  
6. Kant confuses the psychological and logical meanings of “concept.”  
7. Mental imagery can serve as a vehicle for conceptual analysis.  
8. Mental imagery can also be an object of empirical study.  
9. Kant’s views on synthetic a priori truths reflect his conflation of psychology with logic.  
10. Kant’s claims about causality, personal identity, and rationality are fundamentally correct.  
11. Kant’s reasoning must be “de-psychologized” to be valid.  
12. A proposition is a non-linguistic entity expressed by a sentence.  
13. Kant’s definitions of “analytic” and “a priori” are flawed.  
14. Analyticity should be understood as conceptual necessity.  
15. Kant’s use of “containment” in defining analyticity is metaphorical and inadequate.  
16. Kant’s definition of analyticity fails for non-subject-predicate statements.  
17. For Kant, analytic = conceptually true.  
18. Synthetic a priori truths, for Kant, are known a priori but not grounded in concepts alone.  
19. 7+5=12 is analytic, not synthetic.  
20. A straight line is the shortest distance between two points is analytic.  
21. Arthur Pap’s argument shows Kant is inconsistent in regarding 7+5=12 as synthetic.  
22. Kant’s argument that 7+5=12 is synthetic confuses psychological grasp with conceptual content.  
23. Kant presupposes anti-realism or psychologism about concepts.  
24. Intuition for Kant is a para-perceptual act of imaging.  
25. Intuition reveals representational necessity, not empirical or conceptual truth.  
26. Intuition does not give knowledge of the external world.  
27. Intuition gives at most a posteriori knowledge of how we must perceive.  
28. On Kant’s view, mathematical truths become empirical if followed to their conclusion.  
29. Kant’s system implies we cannot know noumenal truths.  
30. Learning geometry through imagery is still conceptual analysis.  
31. Kant fails to distinguish imagery as vehicle for analysis vs. imagery as empirical object.  
32. Leibniz correctly noted that diagrams are aids to reasoning, not sources of geometric truth.  
33. Peacocke’s distinction between access to proof and justification applies to imagery.  
34. Transcendental necessity reduces to psychological or conceptual necessity.  
35. Representational limits must be grounded in conceptual impossibilities.  
36. Kant’s position is incoherent: mathematical propositions must describe and not describe the world simultaneously.  
37. Necessary truths do not describe the empirical world.  
38. Kant’s mistake is an overly narrow conception of analyticity.  
39. Some analytic truths are “hard analytic” (non-obvious conceptual truths).  
40. What Kant calls synthetic a priori truths are actually hard analytic truths.  
41. Transcendental arguments are cogent if rephrased in terms of hard analyticity.  
42. There is an analytic connection between rational thought and causal order.  
43. Causation is necessary for coherent thought.  
44. Persistence is a causal notion.  
45. Kant-style arguments can settle questions about scientific explanation.  
46. Hume’s puzzles about induction and causation remain unsolved.  
47. Kant’s solutions falsely presuppose the world is a mental creation.  
48. Hume’s argument about induction presupposes a digital view of events.  
49. Logical relations hold between pieces of information, not states of affairs.  
50. There are no instantaneous states of affairs.  
51. All spatiotemporal descriptions are causal.  
52. Talk of points and instants is elliptical for talk of arbitrarily small events.  
53. Space-time has an analogue, not digital, structure.  
54. Hume’s view projects linguistic digitality onto reality.  
55. Hume’s analysis of force is moot because forces aren’t needed to connect cause and effect.  
56. Temporal order is itself a causal notion.  
57. There is no possible causal connection without actual causal processes.  
58. Hume’s belief in ex nihilo events is false.  
59. Continuity is a causal phenomenon.  
60. Induction consists in positing continuities that de-digitize our description of reality.  
61. Our grounds for induction are perceptual, not propositional.  
62. Perceptual content is non-digital and continuous.  
63. Sensory data is analogue; propositions are digital models of it.  
64. Counter-inductive hypotheses imply discontinuities incompatible with causal continuity.  
65. Propositions are poor models of perceptual data.  
66. Induction is justified by analogue logic, not propositional logic.  
67. Hume’s analysis confuses associative mechanisms with logical reasoning.  
68. Logical relations also hold among non-digital (analogue) data.  
69. Sentence logic is a superficial kind of logic.  
70. The identification of logic with sentence logic is false.  
71. Skepticism about the external world presupposes ex nihilo perceptual events.  
72. Mental events are temporally co-located and causally connected.  
73. Discontinuities in experience are only apparent.  
74. The external world is logically required to account for experiential continuity.  
75. Brain-in-a-vat scenarios still imply formal isomorphism between experience and reality.  
76. Even in deception, there is formal knowledge of the external world.  
77. All spatiotemporal knowledge is synthetic a posteriori.  
78. Given experience, it analytically follows that an external world exists.  
79. Empirical beliefs are not merely probable; they are analogue-logically valid.  
80. The lottery paradox fails because empirical knowledge is not probabilistic in Hume’s sense.  
81. Space and time are causal constructs.  
82. The concept of cause is primitive.  
83. Events are defined causally.  
84. Instants are classes of non-causally related events.  
85. Place is framework-relative and defined causally.  
86. Hume’s positivism has led to philosophical errors.  
87. Justification vs. causation distinction is over-extended in epistemology.  
88. Newton’s discoveries were rationally justified by experience, not merely triggered by it.  
89. Kant and Chomsky’s nativism is a species-empiricism that fails to explain knowledge acquisition.  
90. Evolution cannot replace rational inference as the ground of knowledge.  
91. Innate knowledge exists but does not include specific scientific theories.  
92. Innate knowledge is of two kinds: contingent and analytic.  
93. Induction is a logical, not associative, process.  
94. Hume’s conception of explanation as subsumption under regularities is false.  
95. Explanation consists in uncovering principled, causal relationships.  
96. Psychological explanation is not fundamentally different from physical explanation.  
97. Hempel’s deductive-nomological model is either tautological or false.  
98. Kuhn’s paradigm theory is a reaction to positivism that ends up reinforcing it.  
99. Freud’s unconscious is a logically coherent extension of causal continuity to psychology.  
100. The mind-body problem is only a mystery if one accepts Hume’s statistical conception of causation.
