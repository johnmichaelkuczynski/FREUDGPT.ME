I'll add this material to your Freud database. This appears to be continuation/supplementary material from the General Introduction lectures, particularly the neuroses section (Lectures 16-24). Let me extract the positions systematically:

## WORK-007 SUPPLEMENT: GENERAL INTRODUCTION LECTURES (CONTINUED) - NEW POSITIONS

### DREAM INTERPRETATION METHODOLOGY (Continuation)

1090. Cuneiform deciphering analogy validates psychoanalytic dream interpretation method
1091. Four distinguished decipherors independently verified translations in 1857 proving method validity
1092. Forced/artificial interpretations result from displacement by dream censor
1093. Dream censor creates substitute-formations as allusions not easily recognized
1094. Concealed objects found in unexpected places like contraband in boot soles
1095. Remote extraordinary associations between latent and manifest often comical or witty
1096. Dreamer provides translation through immediate association or abundant material
1097. Father's quarter-hour announcements decoded as "Uhrmensch" (clockman) from "Urmensch" (cave man)
1098. Similarity between puns and dreams reflects shared unconscious mechanisms
1099. Wit originates in foreconscious thought left to unconscious manipulation
1100. Dream jokes lack pleasure-giving quality of ordinary jokes

### PSYCHOANALYSIS AND PSYCHIATRY (Lecture 16)

1101. Psychiatry describes symptoms but lacks causal explanation
1102. Psychiatry doubts its descriptions deserve name of science
1103. Psychoanalysis aims to fill gap in psychiatric foundation
1104. Every neurotic behavior predetermined, not accidental or meaningless
1105. Patient leaving doors open reveals contempt for physician's status
1106. Symptomatic acts indicate important psychological process not known to consciousness
1107. Jealous woman's anonymous letter she herself provoked from maid
1108. Woman's jealousy substitutes for own inadmissible love of son-in-law
1109. Displacement mechanism provides relief as cooling salve on burning wound
1110. Phantasy of husband's infidelity enables wife's own infatuation to persist unconsciously

### NEUROSIS CHARACTERISTICS

1111. Obsession inaccessible to arguments based on logic or facts
1112. Heredity alone insufficient explanation for obsession content
1113. Psychiatry refers to heredity because lacks other explanations
1114. Psychoanalysis reveals unconscious experiences withholding symptom meaning
1115. Every symptom conclusion requires definite unconscious experiences
1116. Symptoms cannot exist if meaning is conscious
1117. As soon as unconscious processes become conscious, symptom disappears
1118. Symptom develops as substitution for something suppressed
1119. Interrupted psychological processes imprisoned in unconscious create symptoms
1120. Therapy works by changing unconscious into conscious

### KNOWLEDGE AND CURE

1121. Knowing and knowing not always same thing psychologically
1122. Physician's knowledge transferred to patient does not dissolve symptoms
1123. Transference of knowledge sets analysis in motion but calls out denial
1124. Patient's knowledge must be founded on inner change through psychic labor
1125. Neurotic held fast somewhere in his past
1126. Amnesias of neurotic play important role in symptom development
1127. Hysterical amnesias extend back to earliest years creating infantile amnesias
1128. Recent provocations of illness also blurred by losses of memory
1129. "Whence" of symptom (external impressions) may be forgotten
1130. "Why" of symptom (internal tendency) establishes unconscious dependence

### COPERNICAN REVOLUTION

1131. Copernican discovery removed earth from center of universe (first insult)
1132. Darwin's evolution robbed man of special creation superiority (second insult)
1133. Psychoanalysis proves ego not master in own home (third insult)
1134. Ego dependent on scanty information about unconscious psychic life
1135. Revolt against psychoanalysis from disturbing peace of world
1136. Criticism escapes academic urbanity constraints against psychoanalysis

### RESISTANCE AND SUPPRESSION (Lecture 19)

1137. Patient confronts analyst with vigorous tenacious resistance throughout treatment
1138. Resistance not recognized as such by patient initially
1139. Patient struggles against help in interests of his malady
1140. Resistance highly varied, subtle, Protean-like in manifold changes
1141. Patient tries every way to escape basic technical rule
1142. Resistance appears as intellectual resistance battling by arguments
1143. Patient curious to learn but desires analysis spare him personally
1144. Compulsion neurotics let doubts entrench resistance position
1145. Transference becomes resistance when libidinal ties exploited against treatment
1146. Overcoming resistance is essential achievement of analysis
1147. True psychoanalysis began when help of hypnotism renounced
1148. Hypnosis drives back resistance but clogs field boundaries

### SUPPRESSION MECHANISM

1149. Resistance proves same forces oppose change that originally caused condition
1150. Pathogenic process made evident through resistance named repression
1151. Repression preliminary condition for symptom formation
1152. Repudiation/condemnation different from repression (conscious vs unconscious)
1153. In repudiation energy withdrawn, impulse becomes powerless but memory remains
1154. In repression impulse retains energy, no memory left, occurs without ego knowledge
1155. Two systems: unconscious (ante-chamber) and fore-conscious (parlor)
1156. Watchman on threshold (censor) passes or rejects impulses
1157. Impulses sent back by watchman are suppressed (unsuitable for consciousness)
1158. Watchman is resistance encountered in analytic treatment
1159. Crude spatial metaphor useful for understanding unconscious system
1160. Suppression differs from repression (localized vs process-based)

### SUPPRESSION DYNAMICS

1161. Interfering tendencies divide into three groups by suppression degree
1162. Group 1: tendency known and felt before slip
1163. Group 2: tendency recognized afterward but not felt before
1164. Group 3: tendency energetically denied as ever present
1165. Suppression of intention to say something indispensable for slip
1166. Why doesn't suppression succeed completely or fail completely (special conditions needed)
1167. Suppression grows out of forces of ego (character traits)
1168. Two questions: what kinds of intentions interfere, what proportions relate them
1169. Interfering intention may contradict, correct, supplement, or be unrelated
1170. Common quality links interfering to interfered intention

### SEXUAL LIFE OF MAN (Lecture 20)

1171. Sexual not simply equatable with indecent or genital
1172. Biological improbability that children have no sexual life before puberty
1173. Function of reproduction only one aspect of sexuality
1174. Reproduction

 avails itself of physical and psychic material already present
1175. Confusing sexuality with reproduction blocks understanding of perversions and neuroses
1176. Society must control sexual instinct to preserve cultural achievements
1177. Task of guiding sexual will must begin before puberty storm
1178. Educational ideal to render child's life asexual is convention not reality
1179. Children themselves assert animal rights proving purity road still before them
1180. Period up to five or six years offers striking evidence against asexual childhood conception

### INFANTILE SEXUALITY

1181. Libido is force through which sex instinct expresses itself (analogous to hunger)
1182. Suckling reveals first sexual impulses in connection with feeding
1183. Sucking without food demand shows act yields satisfaction itself
1184. Erogenous zones are body parts yielding sexual pleasure
1185. Mother's breast becomes first object for sexual instinct
1186. Child renders self independent by sucking own body parts (thumb, tongue)
1187. Discovery of genitals through touching finds way from sucking to onanism
1188. Child values faeces as first "present" to give esteemed persons
1189. Everything relating to excretion declared indecent must be concealed
1190. Interest in defecation persists despite intimidation and education

### SEXUAL CURIOSITY AND CASTRATION

1191. Sexual curiosity of children begins very early (before third year)
1192. Boy first denies evidence that female lacks penis (cannot conceive its absence)
1193. Boy becomes subject to domination of castration complex
1194. Castration complex plays important role in character development or neurosis
1195. Girl feels injured by lack of visible penis, envies boy's possession
1196. Girl's wish to be man manifests in subsequent neurosis from failure as woman
1197. Clitoris equivalent of penis in childhood (excitable, auto-erotic satisfaction zone)
1198. Woman's transition requires clitoris sensitivity transfer completely to vagina
1199. Sexual anesthesia results when clitoris obstinately retains excitability
1200. Sexual interest turns first to mystery of birth (sphinx problem)

### THEORIES OF BIRTH

1201. Stork explanation doubted far more frequently than adults imagine
1202. Being cheated of truth by adults contributes to child's solitude
1203. Child's undeveloped sexual constitution restricts understanding ability
1204. Child assumes children produced by special substance in food
1205. Later relinquishes food derivation upon learning only women bear children
1206. Child mistakes sexual act as subjugation attempt (sadistic miscomprehension of coitus)
1207. Child imagines birth takes place through anus (ball of faeces)
1208. Later assumes navel opens or breast region is birthplace
1209. Incomplete disparaging explanation often causes traumatic consequences
1210. Pre-puberty explanation received usually inadequate and harmful

### PERVERSION AND NORMAL DEVELOPMENT

1211. Sexual not unduly expanded by psychoanalysis but restored to proper boundaries
1212. Outside psychoanalysis sexuality means only normal reproductive sexual life
1213. Perversions alone justify sexuality and reproduction not coincident
1214. All perversions disavow goal of reproduction
1215. "Sexual" and "genital" no longer identical (parallel to conscious/psychic expansion)
1216. Sexual perversions subject to peculiar ban extending into theory
1217. Perverse activity unmistakably sexual despite strangeness of object
1218. Orgasm and genital excretion most frequently accompany perverse satisfaction
1219. Normal sex-life rarely entirely free from perverse traits
1220. Kissing can be claimed as perverse (union of erogenous mouth zones)

### PERVERSION CHARACTERISTICS

1221. Essential nature of perversion is exclusiveness of deviations
1222. Normal sexuality takes origin from something existing prior to it
1223. Components thrown out or combined to subject to reproduction aim
1224. Perverse sexuality extraordinarily centralized (whole action toward one goal)
1225. Infantile sexuality devoid of centralization (component impulses equally powerful)
1226. Not everything can be derived from sexuality (non-sexual impulses exist)
1227. Psychoanalysis insisted on distinction between sexual and ego-impulses
1228. Neuroses owe origin to conflict between sexuality and ego (not sexuality alone)
1229. Ego-impulses also pass through significant development
1230. Ego development not entirely independent of libido development

### DEVELOPMENT OF LIBIDO (Lecture 21)

1231. Pre-genital organization loose, not dominated by genitals
1232. Sadistic-anal organization is step antecedent to genital primacy phase
1233. Sadistic-anal phase shows contrast between active and passive (not masculine/feminine)
1234. Oral phase even earlier where erogenous mouth-zone plays chief role
1235. Sexual life not completed whole but goes through successive phases
1236. Development series like grub to butterfly transformation
1237. Turning point is subordination of partial-instincts to genital primacy
1238. Originally diffused sexual life of independent partial instinct activities
1239. Anarchy modified by pre-genital organization approaches
1240. Long evolutionary path of libido carries it over many grades

### OBJECT RELATIONS

1241. Some components have object from beginning (mastery instinct, curiosity, watching)
1242. Other impulses have object only while attached to non-sexual functions
1243. First object of oral component is mother's breast
1244. Oral impulse becomes auto-erotic after giving up foreign object
1245. Development has two goals: give up auto-eroticism; unify objects into single object
1246. Single object must be complete body similar to one's own
1247. Mother is first object of love (first love-object)
1248. Selection of mother as love-object is everything understood by Oedipus complex
1249. Psychic work of suppression began before mother becomes love-object
1250. Oedipus-complex has great significance in psychoanalytic explanation of neuroses

### OEDIPUS COMPLEX

1251. Oedipus-complex aroused great opposition to psychoanalysis
1252. Boy wants mother all to himself, finds father disturbing
1253. Boy becomes irritated when father shows tenderness to mother
1254. Boy expresses satisfaction when father away or on journey
1255. Boy promises mother he will marry her (frequent direct expression)
1256. Child shows contradictory ambivalent emotional attitudes toward parents
1257. Girl's affectionate devotion to father with desire to set aside mother
1258. Parents themselves exert decisive influence in awakening Oedipus attitude
1259. Oedipus-complex expands to family-complex when other children appear
1260. Receiving brothers/sisters with aversion, wishing to remove them

### INCEST AND FAMILY DYNAMICS

1261. Elder child forced into identification with younger by parental equal love
1262. Jealousy transformed into group feeling and identification
1263. First demand of reaction-formation is justice and equal treatment
1264. Boy may take sister as love-object to replace faithless mother
1265. Girl finds in older brother substitute for father
1266. Position in sequence of brothers/sisters of utmost importance for entire life
1267. Most stringent laws necessary to prevent persisting infantile incest tendency
1268. Among primitive races prohibitions against incest more stringent than ours
1269. Puberty-rites have significance of loosing incestuous bonds of boy to mother
1270. Incest with mother and patricide two great sins of Oedipus

### OEDIPUS RESOLUTION

1271. At puberty old incestuous objects taken up again by libido intensely
1272. Very intense emotional experiences directed toward Oedipus-complex
1273. Individual must devote himself to great task of freeing from parents
1274. Son must free himself from libidinous wishes toward mother
1275. Son must effect reconciliation with father or free from domination
1276. These tasks set for every man, seldom solution ideally achieved
1277. Neurotics find no solution—son remains subject to father's authority whole life
1278. Daughter's fate similar if unable to transfer libido to foreign sexual object
1279. Oedipus-complex correctly designated as nucleus of neurosis
1280. What people call sexual are perverse incestuous murderous dreams from childhood

### DEVELOPMENT AND REGRESSION (Lecture 22)

1281. Libido development involves two dangers: inhibition and regression
1282. Not all preparatory phases equally well passed through or thoroughly accomplished
1283. Certain components may be permanently held back in early development stage
1284. Fixation of instinct means arrest of partial impulse in earlier stage
1285. Components which achieved progress may readily turn backward (regression)
1286. Regression occurs when function encounters great external difficulties
1287. Stronger the fixations, more readily function evades by regression
1288. Transference neuroses show return to first incestuous objects regularly
1289. Return to earlier sexual organization stages more conspicuous in compulsion neurosis
1290. Suppression has nothing to do with sexuality (purely psychological, localized process)

### COMPLEMENTARY SERIES

1291. Libido fixation represents internal disposing factor in neurosis etiology
1292. Abstinence represents accidental external factor in neurosis etiology
1293. Outer self-denial must be supplemented by inner self-denial to become pathological
1294. Pathological struggle waged between ego-impulses and sexual impulses
1295. Neurotic diseases arrangeable in series where constitution and experience vary inversely
1296. Complementary series shows continuum from extreme constitution to extreme experience
1297. Adhesiveness of libido appears as independent factor (tenacity of clinging)
1298. Sexual constitution plus infantile experience equals libido fixation
1299. Premature fixation of libido indispensable but not solely decisive for neuroses
1300. Perversions show similar libido adhesiveness without being neuroses

### CONFLICT AND EGO DEVELOPMENT

1301. Psychic conflict arises when libido seeks new means after self-denial
1302. Conflict becomes pathogenic when new mode of gratification raises ego's disfavor
1303. Rejected libidinous desires manage own way through circuitous byways as symptoms
1304. Symptoms are new or substitute satisfaction self-denial made necessary
1305. Inner self-denial excludes possibility that outer denial aimed at
1306. Non-sexual ego impulses interpose objections to libidinous desire
1307. Tendency to conflict third factor of neurosis etiology (after denial and fixation)
1308. Tendency to conflict dependent on development of both ego and libido
1309. Where libido subject to fixation, ego undergoes suppression
1310. Ego development in first story vs ground floor example shows conflict formation

### PHYLOGENETIC INHERITANCE

1311. Both ego and libido fundamentally heritages, abbreviated repetitions of evolution
1312. Libido shows phylogenetic origin most readily (genital apparatus variations)
1313. Animals portray perversions set as permanent sexual organizations
1314. Phylogenetic aspect partly clouded by individual development achievement
1315. Originally inherited activities now serve only as stimulus for recollection
1316. Developmental course in individual may be disturbed by recent external influences
1317. Necessity (struggle for existence) forced development upon mankind
1318. Neurotics are children upon whom severity of education had bad effect
1319. Sex instincts more difficult to educate than self-preservation instincts
1320. Sex instincts initially auto-erotic thus withdrawn from educational influence of reality

### PLEASURE AND REALITY PRINCIPLES

1321. Fundamental purpose of psychological apparatus is pursuit of pleasurable excitement
1322. Apparatus regulated automatically by principle of pleasure
1323. Pleasure somehow involves lessening/lowering/obliterating stimuli amount
1324. Pain increases amount of psychic excitation present
1325. Psychic apparatus serves purpose of mastering and bringing to rest stimuli masses
1326. Sexual instincts retain pleasure aim without much change throughout development
1327. Ego instincts learn to qualify pleasure principle through necessity's influence
1328. Task of avoiding pain becomes almost comparable to gain of pleasure
1329. Educated ego becomes "reasonable" controlled by principle of fact
1330. Principle of fact aims at pleasure postponed and lessened by reality considerations

### EGO-REGRESSION

1331. Transition from pleasure to fact principle is most important ego development
1332. Sexual instincts pass through this stage unwillingly and late
1333. Ego like libido has history of evolution (ego-regressions possible)
1334. Ego may return to former phases of development in neurotic disease
1335. Human has not given up evil impulses but only relegated to unconscious
1336. Feeling of guilt persists as responsibility even when purposes unconscious
1337. Consciousness of guilt's source may be in Oedipus-complex
1338. Religion and morality of mankind may derive from Oedipus-complex (Totem and Taboo)
1339. Mourning is emotional fixation on past but sharply distinguished from neurosis
1340. Not every fixation leads to neurosis or sets conditions for neurosis development

### DEVELOPMENT OF SYMPTOMS (Lecture 23)

1341. Symptom understanding equivalent to understanding sickness for present purpose
1342. Symptoms are acts detrimental to life as whole or at least useless
1343. Symptoms frequently obnoxious to individual, accompanied by distaste and suffering
1344. Principal injury lies in psychic exertion symptoms cost
1345. Being sick essentially practical concept dependent on energy quantity
1346. From theoretical standpoint we are all sick or neurotic
1347. Neurotic symptoms result of conflict aroused by new form of libido gratification
1348. Two contending forces meet in symptom, reconciled through compromise
1349. Symptom sustained from both sides, capable of great resistance
1350. Libido frustrated by reality must seek other means for satisfaction

### SYMPTOM FORMATION PROCESS

1351. Libido enticed by fixations left behind at earlier development stages
1352. Development toward perversion branches off sharply from neuroses
1353. If regressions don't awaken ego resistance, neurosis doesn't follow
1354. If ego doesn't approve regression, conflict takes place
1355. Libido locked out must seek refuge where it can find outlet
1356. Libido withdraws to suppressed positions, throws off all acquired influences
1357. Libido harks back to former happier times when unruly
1358. Ideas libido takes over belong to unconscious system
1359. Unconscious ideas subject to processes of elaboration and displacement
1360. Conditions comparable to dream formation set up in symptom development

### UNCONSCIOUS AND SYMPTOM FORMATION

1361. Latent unconscious must contend against power of foreconscious ego
1362. Opposition from ego follows libido down by counter-siege
1363. Symptom comes into being as distorted offshoot from unconscious wish-fulfillment
1364. Symptom is artificially selected ambiguity with two contradictory meanings
1365. Only difference from dream: no insistent "No" opposition to unconscious wish
1366. Libido evasion possible only by virtue of existing fixations
1367. When fixations taken by regression, suppression side-stepped
1368. Libido broke through to gratification via unconscious and old fixations
1369. Intimate connection between libido and unconscious on one hand
1370. Connection between ego, consciousness and reality on other hand

### INFANTILE EXPERIENCES AND FIXATION

1371. Libido finds fixations in infantile sexuality activities and experiences
1372. Abandoned component-impulses and childish objects provide fixation points
1373. Significance of childhood period is double (inborn and environmental)
1374. Congenital tendencies must also have once been acquired (heredity principle)
1375. Infantile experiences deserve especial appreciation despite being heritage
1376. Experiences occur in period of uncompleted development (can cause traumatic effect)
1377. Needle prick into embryonic cell mass causes serious developmental disturbances
1378. Same injury to larva or completed animal borne without injury
1379. Hereditary sexual constitution provides manifold tendencies
1380. Infantile experience builds complementary series within sexual constitution

### CHILDHOOD NEUROSES

1381. Most striking libido regressions conditioned by hereditary constitutional factor
1382. Psychoanalytic investigation shows libido bound to infantile sexual experiences
1383. Danger of mistaken one-sided orientation toward life from neurotic situation
1384. Must subtract influences arising from libido return by regression
1385. Infantile experiences acquire hold on libido greatly augmented by regression
1386. Other considerations: observation shows infantile experiences have particular significance already in childhood
1387. Neuroses in children very frequent, more than generally believed
1388. Often overlooked, dismissed as badness, suppressed by nursery authority
1389. Childhood neurosis recognized later in retrospect
1390. Neuroses occur most frequently as anxiety hysteria in children

### REALITY OF INFANTILE SCENES

1391. Neurosis breaking out in later life often direct continuation of infantile malady
1392. Analytic investigation sometimes discovers infantile scenes are not always true
1393. Often untrue and directly contrary to historical truth
1394. Infantile experiences may be false, undeniably true, or mixture of truth and fiction
1395. Same scattered childhood memories may be falsified as well
1396. Slight regard for reality, neglect to keep fact distinct from phantasy is confusing
1397. Universal regression to childhood period inexplicable without something exerting attraction
1398. Fixation means stabilizing definite amount of libidinous energy
1399. Complementary relationship between intensity and pathogenic significance of experiences
1400. Childhood neuroses can be successfully removed (not permanent conditions)

### PRIMAL PHANTASIES

1401. Primal phantasies are phylogenetic possession
1402. Individual reaches beyond own life into experiences of antiquity through phantasies
1403. Everything obtained in analysis as phantasy once were realities in primeval existence
1404. Seduction of children, sexual excitement from watching intercourse, castration threat were once realities
1405. Imaginative child fills in gaps of individual truth with prehistoric truth
1406. Psychology of neuroses stores up more of human development antiquities than other sources
1407. Phantasy enjoys universal esteem though place in psychic life not clear
1408. Man reserved psychological activity where abandoned pleasure sources continue to exist
1409. Phantasy freed from requirements of reality and test of reality
1410. In imagination man enjoys freedom from external compulsion long since renounced

### PHANTASY AND SYMPTOMS

1411. Psychic realm of fancy like nature reserves withdrawn from reality principle
1412. Day dreams are best known phantasy productions
1413. Day dreams show pictured satisfactions of ambitious, covetous and erotic wishes
1414. Night dream essentially nothing but distorted day dream
1415. Unconscious day dreams exist as source of night dreams and neurotic symptoms
1416. Libido need only retire to imagination to find road to suppressed fixations
1417. Phantasies enjoyed tolerance until certain quantitative condition observed
1418. Return of libido to phantasies heightens energy accumulation making them assertive
1419. Phantasies then subject to suppression by ego and victims to unconscious attraction
1420. Libido wanders from phantasies now unconscious to sources in unconscious and fixation points

### INTROVERSION

1421. Introversion means turning aside of libido from actual satisfaction possibilities
1422. Introversion causes excessive accumulation of previously harmless phantasies
1423. Introvert not yet neurotic but in labile situation
1424. Introvert must develop symptoms at next dislocation of forces without other outlets
1425. Intangible nature of neurotic satisfaction determined by arrest in introversion phase
1426. Quantitative factor must always be taken into account (not just qualitative analysis)
1427. Dynamic conception insufficient, need economic viewpoint as well
1428. Conflict not released until certain occupation-intensities reached
1429. Pathogenic significance of constitutional factors guided by quantitative excess
1430. Predispositions of all men might be qualitatively same, differentiated quantitatively

### ARTISTIC SUBLIMATION

1431. Way back from imagination to reality is art
1432. Artist is incipient introvert not far from being neurotic
1433. Artist impelled by too powerful instinctive needs (honor, power, riches, fame, love)
1434. Artist lacks means of achieving satisfactions so transfers interests to imaginary wishes
1435. Artist's constitution strongly endowed with ability to sublimize
1436. Artist understands how to elaborate day dreams so they lose personal element
1437. Artist knows how to disguise phantasies so not easily disclose despised origins
1438. Artist possesses ability to mold material into faithful image of imagination creatures
1439. Artist attaches to representation so much pleasure it outweighs suppressions
1440. Artist makes possible for others to obtain solace from their unconscious sources

This adds **351 new positions** (1090-1440) covering the dream methodology continuation and comprehensive neuroses lectures. The total would bring your Freud database to **1440 positions** across all works.

Would you like me to:
1. Continue extracting remaining positions from Lecture 24 and any other material?
2. Reorganize these into the same format as your existing database with categories?
3. Create an updated statistics summary?
