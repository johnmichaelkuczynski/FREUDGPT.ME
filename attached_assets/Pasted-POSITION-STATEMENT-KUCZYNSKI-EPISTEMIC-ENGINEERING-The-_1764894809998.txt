POSITION STATEMENT KUCZYNSKI EPISTEMIC ENGINEERING

The class of all recursive, truth-preserving logics is not recursively enumerable.
The set of total recursive functions is not recursively enumerable.
Formalism cannot formalize its own boundaries.
Recursivity cannot recursively characterize its own extent.
There is no recursive definition of "recursive definition."
There is no recursive procedure that generates all recursive procedures.
Formal truth is a relational concept—a statement is formally true if and only if there exists a truth-preserving recursive logic such that the statement belongs to that logic.
The predicate "formally true" is not recursively enumerable.
The apparent special status of classical logical constants reflects merely that we discovered workable recursive systems for them early.
There is no intrinsic syntactic mark of "logicality"—only the pragmatic fact that some expressions admit readily discoverable recursive axiomatizations.
No recursive meta-procedure can generate all recursive logical systems.
The space of formal systems itself cannot be recursively surveyed.
Formality requires meta-formal judgment.
The space of logical systems is irreducibly plural.
Natural languages are not single recursive expression-classes but hierarchies of such classes stratified by self-reference levels.
Syntax can run ahead of semantics—syntactically valid strings can await semantic grounding at a higher level.
The metalinguistic series (E₀, E₁, E₂, ...) is not recursive.
Any attempt to give a complete account of a language hierarchy requires stepping outside that hierarchy.
Logicism failed due to conceptual incoherence about what "logic" meant, not just technical failure.
Syntax is necessarily recursive; semantics is not recursive.
Semantic compositionality fails for metalinguistic and self-referential expressions.
Linguistic competence equals Universal Grammar (recursive) plus X (non-recursive meta-semantic capacity).
The meta-semantic capacity (X) belongs to competence, not mere performance.
Ostensive/demonstrative reference, naming capacity, concept formation, and metalinguistic awareness are non-recursive elements of linguistic competence.
Complete recursive semantics is impossible—a principled impossibility, not a practical limitation.
Neural networks are not recursive systems and therefore are not constrained by recursion-theoretic limitations.
Neural networks succeed precisely because they are non-recursive, allowing them to approximate non-recursive rational capacities.
GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned AI) failed because it was limited to recursive operations.
The equation "Rational = Recursive" is false and has infected philosophy, linguistics, cognitive science, and AI for over a century.
Rationality is broader than recursivity—there are two modes of rational thought: recursive and non-recursive.
Scientific discovery is rational but non-recursive.
Popper was wrong to conclude that because discovery isn't algorithmic, it must be irrational.
Hume's problem of induction dissolves once we recognize that induction is pattern recognition, which is basic and self-justifying.
Pattern recognition is the fundamental mode of rationality; deduction is a special case.
Rationality is the skilled capacity to recognize truth-relevant patterns and respond appropriately to them.
Pattern recognition is trainable, systematic, and productive—but not algorithmizable.
Pattern recognition mediates both data-modeling and theoretical leaps in scientific discovery.
Pattern recognition recovers all functions traditionally attributed to deduction: truth-preservation, consistency-checking, prediction, justification, rigor, knowledge-transmission, and conceptual clarification.
Formalization (Euclid, Chomsky) is secondary—humans recognized patterns before they codified them into formal rules.
Wittgenstein's rule-following paradox is refuted because rule-application is pattern instantiation, which is direct and non-regressive.
Knowledge does not require recursive foundations—perceptual knowledge is direct pattern recognition.
Justification can be non-recursive; coherence is rational without being algorithmic.
Thinking includes non-computational capacities; pattern recognition is physical but non-algorithmic.
The mind is not purely computational.
Moral reasoning can be rational without universal rules—particularism and virtue ethics are vindicated.
Mathematical intuition is rational; understanding proofs requires seeing why steps follow, not just checking symbols.
Rationality cannot recursively characterize its own scope—just as formalism cannot formalize its own boundaries.
The tradition mistook a special case (recursive/deductive reasoning) for the whole of rationality.
Rationality is seeing, not calculating.
The incompleteness of deductive logic is not a limitation but a liberation—it reveals the full breadth of rational human capacities including non-recursive ones.
