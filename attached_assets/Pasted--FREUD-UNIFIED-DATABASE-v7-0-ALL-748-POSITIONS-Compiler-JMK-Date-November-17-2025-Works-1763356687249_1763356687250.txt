## WORK-001 BEYOND THE PLEASURE PRINCIPLE (1920) - 170 POSITIONS
### PHILOSOPHY OF MIND & PSYCHOLOGY
1. Mental processes automatically regulated by pleasure-principle (tension reduction)
2. Complete theory requires topographical, dynamic, AND economic elements (metapsychology)
3. Rate of excitation change more important than absolute quantity for feeling
4. Fechner pleasure/pain relate to stability/instability conditions (equilibrium theory)
5. Psychic apparatus keeps excitation low/constant (constancy principle)
6. Pleasure-principle has limited not absolute supremacy (opposed by other forces)
7. Reality-principle replaces pleasure-principle for adaptation (postponement, renunciation)
8. Repression during development creates neurotic pain = pleasure cannot be experienced
9. Most pain is perceptual unsatisfied instincts OR external danger stimuli

### THEORY OF TRAUMA AND NEUROSIS
10. Traumatic neurosis from severe shock with life danger (not just organic injury)
11. Fright/Fear/Apprehension are distinct Fright = unprepared encounter with danger
12. Apprehension protects against trauma (preparation prevents fright-neurosis)
13. Traumatic dreams violate wish-fulfillment (attempt retroactive apprehension development)
14. Child's fort-da game repeats unpleasant separation for mastery
15. Play transforms passivity to activity (child applies unpleasant to playfellow)
16. Patient repeats rather than remembers (transference as compulsion sphere)
17. Transference-neurosis replaces earlier neurosis in treatment
18. Resistance from ego not from repressed (unconscious strives toward consciousness)
19. Repetition-compulsion revives experiences with no pleasure potential
20. Normal life shows repetition-compulsion (pursuing fate, daemonic destiny)
21. Active vs passive repetition (character trait vs seeming passivity)
22. Repetition-compulsion real existence beyond pleasure-principle established

### INSTINCT THEORY AND DEATH DRIVE
23. Consciousness not universal characteristic but special boundary function
24. Consciousness and memory-trace incompatible in same system
25. System Bw characteristics from exposed position (immediate external contact)
26. Living vesicle surface differentiated by position (burned rind for reception)
27. Protection against stimuli more important than reception
28. Unconscious processes timeless (not chronological)
29. Inner excitations bypass protective barrier (no internal protection)
30. Projection origin treating painful inner as if external (defensive externalization)
31. Trauma = excitations breaking through barrier (relationship to efficacious barrier)
32. Binding traumatic stimuli converting free-flowing to quiescent energy
33. Counter-charge mechanism around breach (impoverishing other systems)
34. Binding force proportionate to quiescent charge level
35. Free-flowing vs quiescent energy distinction (Breuer) fundamental to metapsychology
36. Traumatic neurosis as barrier rupture (old shock theory rehabilitated)
37. Fright = failure of apprehension/preparation mechanism
38. Traumatic dreams re-establish preparation retroactively (not wish-fulfillment)
39. First exception to dream wish-fulfillment principle (traumatic/childhood trauma dreams)
40. Dreams may have prehistoric past function before wish-fulfillment
41. Instinct = conservative tendency toward reinstatement of earlier condition
42. Animal behavior evidence migration, spawning journeys to earlier homes
43. Embryonic development repeats ancestral forms (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny)
44. Regeneration demonstrates conservative organic tendency
45. All instincts aim at earlier condition (development from external forces only)
46. Evolution result of external forces (conservative instincts store enforced changes)
47. The goal of all life is death - return to inorganic starting point
48. Life origin properties awakened in lifeless matter (baffling force created tension)
49. First instinct = return to lifelessness (death drive most primitive)
50. Circuitous routes to death = phenomena of life (external forces compelled detours)
51. Self-preservation instincts = part-instincts securing peculiar death path
52. Organism dies only its own way (watchmen of life = myrmidons of death)
53. Sexual instincts exception (not all organisms developed; many stayed primitive)
54. Reproductive cells retain original structure (detach charged with dispositions)
55. Germ cells operate against death (potential immortality through regeneration)
56. Fortification through mingling (sexual union essential for life function)
57. Sexual instincts specially conservative (resistant, preserve life longer = life-instincts)
58. Contradiction between life/death instincts (oscillating rhythm in organisms)
59. Sexuality not at dawn of life but opposition to ego-instincts may have been
60. No general impulse toward higher development (no examples counter to conservative)
61. Higher development often balanced by retrogression (relative valuation)
62. No impulse toward perfection in man (reject superman concept)
63. Striving for perfection = repression effect (culture built on repression)
64. Excess demand over satisfaction creates driving momentum (Mephisto urges ever forward)
65. Path back barred by repression (forward movement = failed regression)
66. Perfection impulse not universal (minority phenomenon, rare economic conditions)
67. Sharp antithesis ego-instincts (death) vs sexual instincts (life)
68. Ego-instincts from vitalizing inanimate matter (aim = lifelessness reinstatement)
69. Sexual union as condition for immortality (germ cell death without it)
70. What does sexual reproduction repeat (Unanswered; would relieve if theory wrong)
71. Testing natural death assumption (made light-heartedly, consolatory belief)
72. Natural death may be illusion (alien to primitive races = enemy/spirit attribution)
73. Little biological agreement on death (conception eludes biologists)
74. Weismann mortal soma vs immortal germ-plasm distinction
75. Weismann's differentiation only for multicellular (unicellular = immortal)
76. Death as purposive contrivance for multicellular (adaptation not necessity)
77. Death became possible/expedient with soma/germ-plasm differentiation
78. Propagation not introduced with death (primordial like growth)
79. Late death doesn't help death instinct theory (would undermine it)
80. Debate over Weismann not decisive (multiple conflicting views)
81. Protozoa subject to death (coincides with propagation but disguised)
82. Woodruff slipper-animalcule to 3029th generation (immortality experiment)
83. Contradictory findings Maupas/Calkins found aging/death in infusoria
84. Conjugation prevents aging (rejuvenation through mingling)
85. Invigorating influence replaceable (chemical/mechanical stimuli work too)
86. Infusoria die from own metabolic products (natural death mechanism)
87. Own products fatal but not related species products (proved convincingly)
88. All higher animals die from metabolic product disposal inability
89. Doubt about studying death in protozoa (primitive organization may conceal)
90. Dynamic vs morphological viewpoint shift (indifferent if protozoa death proved)
91. Death-instincts may be active from beginning (obscured by life forces)
92. Even protozoa immortality doesn't invalidate hypothesis (manifestation vs process)
93. Weismann distinction/death-life instinct distinction resemblance unshaken
94. Hering anabolic vs katabolic processes = our two instinctive tendencies
95. Convergence with Schopenhauer (death = real result; sex = will to live)
96. Multicellularity as life-prolongation means (one cell helps preserve others)
97. Conjugation has preservative/rejuvenating effect (prototype for sexual effect)
98. Libido theory applied to cells (sexual instincts in each cell neutralize death-instincts)
99. Germ cells behave narcissistically (concentrate libido on self for later construction)
100. Malignant growths as narcissistic (pathology sees embryonal attributes)

### LIBIDO THEORY DEVELOPMENT
101. Initial opposition sexual vs ego-instincts (transference-neuroses analysis)
102. Psychoanalysis adhered to hunger and love distinction
103. Extension of sexuality concept (beyond propagation function)
104. Psychoanalysis approached psychological ego (repressing/censoring agency)
105. Objections to narrow libido concept (critics lacked alternative)
106. Libido withdrawn from object to ego (introversion observation)
107. Ego as sexual object (choicest among them)
108. Narcissistic libido = sexual instinct energy (identified with self-preservation)
109. Part of ego-instincts recognized as libidinous
110. Difference now topographical not qualitative (ego vs object investment)
111. Accentuating libidinous character of self-preservation instincts
112. Risk of having only libidinous instincts (critics right about pansexualism)
113. Result not intended (started with sharp ego/sexual distinction)
114. Dualistic standpoint maintained (life vs death instincts now)
115. Jung's monistic confusion (libido = all instinctive energy)
116. Analysis of ego progress insufficient (hard to demonstrate other instincts)
117. Narcissism conjecture already present (ego-instincts drew libidinous components)
118. Analysis only demonstrates libidinous impulses (doesn't prove no others)
119. New polarity love (tenderness) vs hate (aggression)
120. Sadism as death-instinct component (long recognized in sexuality)
121. Sadism derived from death-instinct (driven from ego by narcissistic libido)
122. Sadism's progressive role in sexuality (oral→separation→genital primacy)
123. Hate-love ambivalence setup (where sadism experiences no fusion)
124. Masochism as return to earlier phase (recoil of sadism onto ego)
125. Masochism may be primary (correction of earlier denial)
126. Conjugation effect as prototype (strengthening/rejuvenating in protozoa)
127. Blending introduces new stimulus masses (life renewal mechanism)
128. Union increases chemical tensions (life process otherwise equalizes to death)
129. Nirvana-principle recognition (struggle for stimulus tension removal)
130. Sexual instinct lacks repetition-compulsion character (disturbing for theory)
131. Germ cells as repetitions (sexual propagation repeats organic beginning)
132. Must enquire into sexual propagation origin (lay mind quails, specialists unsolved)
133. Sex as advantageous amphimixis utilization (Darwinian view)
134. Amphimixis from fortuitous conjugation (sex not ancient; repeat what chanced)
135. Same question recurs for sex as for death (crediting protozoa with more)
136. Objection presupposes life-instincts from beginning (conjugation retained/elaborated)
137. Working with two unknown quantities (sex origin obscure as death)
138. Plato's Aristophanes myth (fantastic but fulfills one condition)
139. Plato's three original sexes (third had equal share in male/female)
140. Zeus divided original beings (longing for other half, desired to grow together)
141. Daring assumption of original rent (living substance split, strives for reunion)
142. Sexual instincts continue chemical affinity (from inanimate matter)
143. Dispersed fragments achieve multicellular organization (transfer reunion instinct to germ cells)

### EPISTEMOLOGY & METHODOLOGY
144. Uncertainty about personal conviction (neither convinced nor seeking conviction)
145. Following thought as scientific curiosity (advocatus diaboli permissible)
146. Third step less certain than first two (sexuality extension/narcissism more solid)
147. Regressive instinct character based on observation (repetition-compulsion facts)
148. Departing far from observation (combining facts with imagination repeatedly)
149. Distrust of intuition (impartiality of intellect rare on ultimate questions)
150. Deep-rooted preferences control speculation (unwittingly playing into their hands)
151. Self-criticism doesn't require tolerance (reject contradicted theories; know own tentative)
152. No disturbance from surprising processes (instinct expelled, turning, etc. expected from metaphor)
153. Obliged to use metaphorical language (psychology of deeper layers requires it)
154. Psychological terms are metaphors (like physiological/chemical would be)
155. Biology may overthrow hypothesis structure (limitless possibilities expected)
156. Perhaps overthrow whole structure (someone may ask why communicate it then)

### FUNCTION AND TENDENCY
157. Distinguish function from tendency (pleasure-principle = tendency serving function)
158. Cannot yet decide between conceptions (eliminate excitation vs keep constant/low)
159. Greatest pleasure in temporary quenching (sexual climax as paradigm)
160. Bound vs unbound processes and sensation (unbound = more intense both directions)
161. Primary processes earlier in time (beginning of mental life)
162. Search for pleasure more intense at beginning (but less unrestrictedly)
163. Dominance more assured at maturity (though still limited)
164. Further studies required on tension (tension may be pleasurable or painful itself)
165. Questions about bound/unbound and tension (sensation correlates unclear)
166. Life-instincts appear as disturbers (make appearance, bring tension states)
167. Death-instincts function unostentatiously (pleasure-principle serves death)
168. Innumerable questions without answers (must be patient, ready to abandon path)
169. Only true believers expect science as creed substitute (others take amiss theory development)
170. Consolation in slow scientific progress (limping is no sin)

517. Choosing psychoanalysis as profession ruins university success
518. Society regards psychoanalysis with suspicion and hostility
519. Psychoanalysis demonstrated through interchange of words only
520. Words retain magical power (not mere talk)
521. Psychoanalytic conversation brooks no auditor (requires privacy)
522. Patient's communications concern most intimate psychic life
523. Communications deal with what person won't admit to himself
524. Cannot observe psychoanalytic treatment directly (only by hearsay)
525. Understanding psychoanalysis depends on faith in instructor
526. Psychoanalysis learned through study of one's own personality
527. Best method is being analyzed by competent analyst
528. Self-analysis has definite limits compared to being analyzed
529. Medical training directs attention away from psychic life
530. Lack of philosophical science of therapy for medical purposes

### EPISTEMOLOGY & RESISTANCE (15)
531. No speculative philosophy or descriptive psychology provides practical therapeutic knowledge
532. Experimental psychology allied with sense physiology insufficient
533. Psychiatry describes symptoms but lacks causal explanation
534. Psychiatry doubts its own descriptions deserve name of science
535. Psychoanalysis aims to fill gap in psychiatric foundation
536. Psychoanalysis must divorce itself from anatomical/chemical/physiological suppositions
537. Psychoanalysis works with purely psychological concepts
538. First assertion: psychic processes are in themselves unconscious
539. Conscious processes are merely isolated acts of total psychic life
540. Common view identifies psychic with conscious (psychoanalysis rejects this)
541. Psychoanalysis defines psychic as feeling/thinking/willing processes
542. Unconscious thinking and unconscious willing exist
543. Acceptance of unconscious processes leads to new orientation in science
544. Second assertion: sexual impulses play large role in nervous/mental disease causation
545. Sexual impulses contribute to highest cultural/artistic/social achievements

### CULTURE AND SEXUALITY (12)
546. Civilization forged by vital necessity at cost of instinct-satisfaction
547. Each individual repeats sacrifice of instinct-satisfaction for common good
548. Sexual impulses play significant role among utilized instinctive forces

556. Prejudices against psychoanalysis held despite attempts at refutation
557. Psychoanalysis claims right to reject practical considerations in research

### PSYCHOLOGY OF ERRORS: FOUNDATIONS (25)
558. Errors are very frequent, familiar, little heeded phenomena
559. Errors observable in every normal person
560. Errors include slips of tongue/pen/reading, mishearing, forgetting
561. Temporary forgetting distinct from permanent forgetting
562. Mislaying and losing things as forms of forgetting
563. Erroneous ideas have transient character
564. Errors are unimportant, temporary, without much life significance
565. Small signs can betray very important things
566. Faint signs reveal what conspicuous manifestations conceal
567. Modest research with discoverable method more fruitful than grand resolutions
568. Connection links small to great in scientific research
569. Popular view: errors are slight accidents not worth explanation
570. Denying natural determination at one point vitiates entire scientific viewpoint
571. Religious viewpoint more consistent (no sparrow falls without God's wish)
572. Errors occur with special frequency when tired/ill/excited
573. Forgetting names frequent when indisposed
574. Distraction concentrating attention elsewhere causes errors
575. Illness and circulatory disorders provide physiological basis for errors
576. Fatigue/distraction/excitement are psycho-physiological conditions
577. Attention theory: errors from scattering of attention
578. Not everything squares with attention theory
579. Automatic acts can be carried out successfully with little attention
580. Virtuoso practice makes errors less likely not more
581. Excitement should intensify attention on desired goal
582. Attention theory doesn't explain all error phenomena

### MEANING AND STRUCTURE OF ERRORS (28)
583. Errors can be regarded from perspective of what they result in
584. Meringer and Mayer differentiated distortions descriptively
585. Categories: interchanges of words/syllables, perseverations, compoundings, substitutions
586. Most frequent slips: saying word resembling intended word
587. Opposites have close relationship in psychology of association
588. Common slips say exact opposite of what was meant
589. Facile associations can arise inopportunely
590. Previous phrase influences slip even without being spoken
591. Product of slip can itself make sense as valid psychic act
592. Slip has right to be considered valid manifestation with content/meaning
593. In some errors the slip expresses obvious meaning
594. Slips used by poets indicate they consider errors meaningful
595. Poets create slips on purpose for dramatic effect
596. Portia's slip in Merchant of Venice reveals concealed love
597. Shakespeare understood meaning of errors
598. Lichtenberg's observation anticipated theory of misreadings
599. All dreams fulfill wishes but not all errors meaningful
600. Error meaning is purpose/intention/position in psychic sequence
601. Errors arise through mutual interference of two intentions
602. Most frequent errors: one intention contains opposite of other
603. Slips can express antithetical meaning through distortion
604. Slips add second meaning to intended one
605. Abbreviation and condensation in certain slips
606. Some slips unintelligible but result from interference of two speeches
607. Distortion of names can be insult in disguised form
608. Errors can have comical or absurd effect indicating disrespect
609. Name distortions occur as intentional insult device
610. Harmless words made obscene can be slip or intentional wit

### INTERFERENCE MECHANISMS (22)
611. Errors solved through collaboration/interference of two different intentions
612. Explanation valid for most if not all tongue slips
613. Same conception extends to other types of errors
614. Bodily factors (fatigue/illness) only facilitate errors not cause them
615. Bodily predispositions not necessary conditions for errors
616. Loneliness and darkness analogy: facilitation vs causation distinction
617. Sound relationships and word resemblances facilitate but don't explain slips
618. Association tendencies serve only to facilitate not cause slips
619. Wundt's theory (association gains upper hand when fatigued) incomplete
620. Two mutually antagonistic tendencies produce errors
621. Intention interfered with always unmistakable (person acknowledges it)
622. Interfering tendency causes doubt and hesitation
623. In some cases both tendencies equally plain from slip effect
624. Most direct method: ask speaker what he meant to say
625. Speaker immediately supplies originally intended expression
626. Same method discovers interfering meaning
627. This investigation is prototype of psychoanalysis
628. Subject's first association is not arbitrary but determined
629. Psychic fact must be respected (not dismissed as arbitrary)
630. Illusion of psychic freedom must be given up
631. Solution discovered by analyzed subject himself in psychoanalysis
632. Subject may deny interfering intention energetically

### VERIFICATION AND INTERPRETATION (18)
633. When subject acknowledges slip meaning, no doubt remains
634. When subject denies information, direct proof unavailable
635. Judge/defendant analogy: confession vs denial
636. Subject's denial doesn't eliminate interfering intention
637. Resistance reveals personal interest in slip being meaningless
638. Science consists chiefly of assertions at various probability levels
639. Scientific thinking content with approximations of certainty
640. Interpretations derived from multiple sources not just subject's statement
641. Analogies with non-error phenomena provide evidence
642. Psychic situation provides interpretive context
643. Character of person who made error is relevant
644. Impressions received before error are relevant
645. General principles help find meaning first as conjecture
646. Subsequent developments can verify conjectures
647. Accumulated errors show stubbornness incompatible with accident
648. Combined errors reveal essential element of error is purpose
649. Interchange of error types shows purpose more important than form
650. Case of repeated forgetting (Jones' letter) shows persistent opposition

### FORGETTING AND MISLAYING (20)
651. Forgetting names often indicates something against name-bearer
652. Mr. Y forgot rival's name repeatedly showing aversion
653. Lady forgot friend's married name due to dislike of husband
654. Forgetting projects commonly traced to antagonistic current
655. Patron's apology for forgetting indicates unwillingness
656. Popular conception recognizes forgetting as meaningful in practice
657. Forgetting appointments/promises suggests opposition
658. Military excuse of forgetting is useless and rightly so
659. Everyone agrees certain errors are significant (forgetting)
660. Shaw's Caesar forgets to say goodbye showing superiority claim
661. Loss of object may serve purpose of getting rid of it
662. Young man lost pencil from disliked brother-in-law
663. Persons lose objects after falling out with donors
664. Objects lost when no longer liked (pretext for replacement)
665. Letting things fall/break shows same anti-object intention
666. School child loses belongings before birthday for new ones
667. Mislaying can reflect temporary desire to eliminate object
668. Young man mislaid wife's gift book during marital coolness
669. Book found when wife showed her best qualities
670. With cessation of motive, inability to find object ended

### THREE GROUPS OF INTERFERING INTENTIONS (13)
671. Interfering tendencies divide into three groups
672. First group: interfering tendency known and felt before slip
673. Second group: interfering tendency recognized as own but not felt active before
674. Third group: interfering intention energetically denied by speaker
675. Subject denies interfering intention was ever active
676. Subject claims interfering intention alien to him
677. All three groups share common mechanism
678. Suppressed intention obtains expression against speaker's will
679. Suppression of intention indispensable condition for error occurrence
680. In first group intention present before utterance then suppressed
681. In second group suppression extends farther back
682. Third group involves long-term suppression
683. Suppression of existing intention to say something causes slip

### COMPROMISE FORMATIONS AND SYMPTOMATIC ACTS (16)
684. Errors are compromise formations (partial success/failure for both intentions)
685. Endangered intention neither completely suppressed nor wholly intact
686. Special conditions must exist for compromise formation
687. Errors widen province of psychic phenomena considerably
688. Errors are meaningful psychic acts not mere accidents
689. Error phenomena result from psychic not organic influences
690. Meaning = significance/purpose/tendency/position in psychic relations
691. Accidental and symptomatic acts related to errors
692. Symptomatic acts appear unmotivated, insignificant, superfluous
693. Symptomatic acts lack another intention with which they collide
694. Symptomatic acts include playful performances with clothing/body/objects
695. Humming melodies are symptomatic acts
696. All symptomatic acts are meaningful and interpretable like errors
697. Symptomatic acts are small manifestations of important psychic processes
698. Symptomatic acts are valid psychic acts
699. Errors allow psychoanalytic inquiries to be worked out clearly

### RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN INTENTIONS (18)
700. Two questions: what kinds of intentions interfere, what proportions relate them
701. Interfering intention may contradict/correct/supplement interfered intention
702. Or interfering intention has nothing to do with interfered intention
703. First relation found in cases where opposite is said
704. Political editor writes "interested" instead of "disinterested"
705. Representative says "rueckgratlos" (spineless) instead of "rueckhaltlos" (unreserved)
706. Second type: correction/addition/continuation by second tendency
707. "Things were refiled" = "revealed" + "filthy"
708. "One finger" = "fingers of one hand" but really only one person
709. "Whatever I want" = husband's wants controlled by wife
710. Slip arises from content or connected to intention interfered with
711. Other type: interfering intention unrelated to content interfered with
712. Interference originates in just-previous thought process
713. Perseveration but not necessarily of spoken words
714. Associative connection artificially restored with forced links
715. Example: lady says "nach Hose" instead of "nach Hause" (suppressed "drawers")
716. Suppressed content breaks through in next sentence
717. Common quality links interfering to interfered intention

### SUPPRESSION AND RESISTANCE (31)
718. Interfering intentions fall into three groups by suppression degree
719. Group 1: tendency known to speaker and felt before slip
720. Group 2: tendency recognized afterward but not felt before
721. Group 3: tendency energetically denied as ever present
722. Example "refiled": speaker admits judgment "filthy" and intended expression
723. Group 2: interfering tendency immediately recognized but surprised by it
724. Group 3: interpretation energetically denied by speaker
725. Toastmaster ("hiccough") absolutely denied interfering intention
726. Intentions unknown to speaker can manifest themselves
727. Carrying through error conception requires accepting unknown intentions
728. Suppressed intention in first two groups recognized by speaker
729. In Group 1 intention showed itself before slip then suppressed
730. Intention prevented from speech conversion then emerged as slip
731. Suppressed tendency obtains expression against will
732. Changes permitted expression or mixes with it or replaces it
733. This is the mechanism of tongue slip
734. Must assume three groups differentiated by suppression effectiveness
735. Group 1: intention present and perceptible before utterance
736. Group 2: suppression prevents perception before speaking
737. Group 3: suppression extends over long time, perhaps very long
738. Suppressed intention doesn't become perceptible in Group 3
739. Cannot be directly denied because not conscious in Group 3
740. Suppression of intention to say something is indispensable for slip
741. Why doesn't suppression succeed completely or fail completely
742. Errors are compromise formations between intentions
743. Special unknown conditions must exist for compromise formation
744. Must examine other obscure psychic fields for analogies
745. Working with small signs brings dangers (paranoia uses excessively)
746. Broad basis of observations protects from error
747. Dynamic conception of psychic phenomena (not mere description)
748. Perceived phenomena give way to assumed strivings/tendencies
