First, the argument commits a basic category error regarding the nature of linguistic meaning. As established in LANG-017, "linguistic meaning is not reducible to mental states or psychological facts." The contention that linguistic expressions must be "deciphered" because they are "representations, not presentations" falsely assumes that meaning is constituted by mental processing or psychological decoding operations. This is precisely the mentalist fallacy that must be rejected.

The argument's central claim about "vicious regression" rests on the false premise that linguistic meaning necessarily involves mental mediation. However, as demonstrated in LANG-001, we must maintain the fundamental distinction between "literal meaning" and "information through which one identifies that meaning." The process of identifying or accessing meaning is categorically distinct from meaning itself. The argument conflates these distinct levels of analysis.

Furthermore, the position fails to recognize the crucial distinction established in LANG-021 between "literal meaning (semantic content)" and "cognitive significance." Even if we grant that mental processing involves representations rather than presentations, this fact about cognitive processing does not bear on the nature of literal semantic content itself. The argument illegitimately moves from claims about mental processing to conclusions about semantic content.

The theoretical framework vindicated by empirical evidence from large language models provides decisive counterevidence to this position. As established in LANG-033, "large language models demonstrate a clear distinction between semantic content (literal meaning) and pragmatic interpretation (context-dependent meaning). The success of LLMs requires maintaining this distinction, vindicating classical theories of meaning against pragmatist attempts to collapse semantics into pragmatics." The successful operation of these systems demonstrates that semantic content can be processed and manipulated without the kind of mental mediation that the argument claims is necessary.

Additionally, LANG-065 establishes that "two utterances with the same literal meaning may convey very different bodies of information to those who know that literal meaning." This demonstrates that the informational content accessible through linguistic expressions is not identical to their literal meaning. The argument's focus on "information-bearing mental entities" therefore misses the target entirely - it addresses questions about information processing rather than questions about semantic content proper.

The argument's claim about "overextending the concept of what it is to be a linguistic symbol" reveals a misunderstanding of the methodological constraints on semantic theorizing. As established in METHOD-004, "semantic theories must respect known pragmatic principles. Can't just assert 'implicature explains it' without checking constraints." The proper approach is not to restrict the concept of linguistic symbols to avoid theoretical problems, but to ensure that our semantic theories are properly constrained by empirical and theoretical adequacy conditions.

Finally, the argument's concluding claim that "for a given mental entity to bear this as opposed to that information is for that entity to have this as opposed to that causal role" and that "this view is demonstrably false" fails to engage with the actual theoretical framework. As supported by LANG-027, the "demonstrated capabilities" of language processing systems "provide empirical support for classical theories of meaning, particularly the distinction between semantics (literal meaning) and pragmatics (communicated meaning), and the reality of compositional literal meaning."

The argument therefore fails on multiple levels: it misconceives the nature of linguistic meaning, conflates distinct theoretical levels, and ignores decisive empirical evidence from computational systems that successfully process semantic content without the problematic mental mediation that the argument claims is necessary.
