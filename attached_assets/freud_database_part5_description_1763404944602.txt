POSITIONS BY PRIMARY DOMAIN
========================================


============================================================
DOMAIN: ANAL
============================================================
Positions: 6

FREUD-0280: The anal zone retains considerable susceptibility to genital stimulation throughout life, and intestinal disturbances in childhood have a determining influence on later neurotic symptoms
Source: Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality
Type: etiological_claim
Additional domains: erotogenic_zone, neurosis, development, symptom_formation

FREUD-0281: Children making use of the anal zone hold back their stool to produce violent muscular contractions and powerful pleasurable stimulation of the mucous membrane as it passes through the anus
Source: Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality
Type: clinical_observation
Additional domains: infantile_sexuality, pleasure, clinical_observation

FREUD-0282: The contents of the bowels are treated as part of the infant's own body, representing his first 'gift' - by producing them he expresses active compliance with environment, by withholding them his disobedience
Source: Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality
Type: theoretical_claim
Additional domains: feces, gift, compliance, infantile_sexuality

FREUD-0283: From being a 'gift' feces later acquire the meaning of 'baby' - for babies, according to one sexual theory of children, are acquired by eating and born through the bowels

Type: theoretical_claim
Additional domains: feces, baby, infantile_sexual_theories, symbolism

FREUD-0284: The prohibition against getting pleasure from anal activity and its products has a decisive effect on the child's whole development - this is the first occasion the infant glimpses an environment hostile to instinctual impulses and learns to separate his entity from the alien one, carrying out his first repression

Type: theoretical_claim
Additional domains: prohibition, repression, development, civilization

============================================================
DOMAIN: AUTO EROTISM

Additional domains: cathexis, regulation, psychical_apparatus


============================================================

============================================================
DOMAIN: EROTOGENIC ZONE
============================================================
Positions: 5

============================================================
DOMAIN: GENITAL

============================================================
DOMAIN: INFANTILE SEXUALITY

Source: On Dreams
Type: theoretical_claim

Source: Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality
Type: methodological_claim
Additional domains: sexual_instinct, development, methodology

Source: Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality
Type: theoretical_claim
Additional domains: perversion, erotogenic_zones, unpleasure, reaction_formation

FREUD-0268: Sexual activity makes a child ineducable, which is why educators stigmatize every sexual manifestation as a vice, though they cannot do much against it

FREUD-0270: Many children proceed from thumb-sucking to masturbation, showing continuity between oral and genital sexuality
Source: Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality
Type: clinical_observation
Additional domains: oral, masturbation, development, continuity

FREUD-0277: The three essential characteristics of infantile sexual manifestation are: (1) it attaches itself to vital somatic functions, (2) it has no sexual object and is thus auto-erotic, (3) its sexual aim is dominated by an erotogenic zone
Source: Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality
Type: theoretical_claim
Additional domains: characteristics, auto_erotism, erotogenic_zone

============================================================
DOMAIN: INSTINCT
============================================================

Source: Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality
Type: theoretical_claim
Additional domains: degeneracy, civilization, normality

FREUD-0249: The choice between 'innate' and 'acquired' does not cover all issues involved in inversion - both factors must cooperate rather than being mutually exclusive explanations
Source: Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality

============================================================
DOMAIN: MASTURBATION
============================================================

============================================================
DOMAIN: NEUROSIS

============================================================
DOMAIN: PRIMARY PROCESS
============================================================
Positions: 1

============================================================
DOMAIN: PSYCHONEUROSIS
============================================================

============================================================
DOMAIN: PSYCHOPATHOLOGY

Source: The Interpretation of Dreams

============================================================
DOMAIN: SEXUALITY
============================================================
Positions: 6

FREUD-0237: Popular opinion's view of the sexual instinct - that it is absent in childhood, sets in at puberty, and aims at sexual union - gives a very false picture containing numerous errors and hasty conclusions

============================================================
DOMAIN: SUBLIMATION
============================================================
