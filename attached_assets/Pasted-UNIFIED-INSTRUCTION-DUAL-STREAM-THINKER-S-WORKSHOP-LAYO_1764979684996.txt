UNIFIED INSTRUCTION: DUAL-STREAM “THINKER’S WORKSHOP” LAYOUT
Overview
Transform the current flat, terminal-like interface into a visually immersive, dual-panel experience. The left panel streams the AI-generated answer in real time, styled as a living dialogue with historical thinkers. The right panel simultaneously displays the original source texts (or relevant excerpts) from which the answer is being synthesized, styled as a dynamic, interactive archive.
