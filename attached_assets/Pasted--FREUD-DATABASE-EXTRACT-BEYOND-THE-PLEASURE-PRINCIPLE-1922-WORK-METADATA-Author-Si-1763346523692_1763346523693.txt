## PHILOSOPHICAL POSITIONS

### PHILOSOPHY OF MIND / PSYCHOLOGY

**Position 1: The Pleasure Principle as Regulatory Mechanism**
- The course of mental processes is automatically regulated by the pleasure-principle
- Any given mental process originates in unpleasant tension and determines a path leading to relaxation of tension (avoidance of pain/production of pleasure)
- This introduces the "economic" point of view into psychoanalysis
- The pleasure principle represents the most primitive regulatory function of the psychic apparatus

**Position 2: The Economic Point of View in Metapsychology**
- A complete psychological theory must include topographical, dynamic, AND economic elements
- The economic element concerns the quantity and distribution of psychic energy/excitation
- This "metapsychological" approach is the most complete framework available
- Pain corresponds with increase in excitation quantity; pleasure with decrease

**Position 3: Primacy of Quantity Over Quality in Affect**
- The decisive factor for feeling is not absolute quantity but the amount of diminution or increase in a given time
- There is no simple direct proportion between stimulus strength and feeling intensity
- The primary processes generate more intense sensations than bound/secondary processes

**Position 4: Fechner's Psycho-Physical Stability Principle**
- Pleasure/pain bear psycho-physical relationship to conditions of stability and instability
- Pleasure is charged in proportion as psycho-physical movement approximates complete equilibrium beyond a certain limit
- Pain is charged in proportion as it departs from equilibrium beyond a certain limit
- Between limits exists an "area of aesthetic indifference"

**Position 5: The Constancy Principle**
- The psychic apparatus attempts to keep quantity of excitation as low as possible or at least constant
- This tendency can be classified as Fechner's "tendency towards stability"
- Anything tending to increase excitation is felt as contrary to function (painful)
- The pleasure-principle is deduced from the principle of constancy

**Position 6: Limitations on Pleasure Principle Supremacy**
- It is not strictly correct to speak of supremacy of the pleasure-principle
- A strong tendency toward pleasure exists but is opposed by other forces and conditions
- Most psychic processes are NOT accompanied by pleasure (ordinary experience contradicts supremacy)
- The ultimate issue cannot always accord with the pleasure-tendency

**Position 7: Reality-Principle as Modification**
- The pleasure-principle is adjusted to primary mode of operation
- For organism preservation in external world, it is ab initio useless and dangerous
- Under ego's self-preservation instinct, it is replaced by reality-principle
- Reality-principle demands postponement of satisfaction, renunciation of possibilities, temporary endurance of pain
- Pleasure-principle remains method of sex-impulses longer (less educable)

**Position 8: Repression as Source of Pain**
- Another source of pain: conflicts during ego development toward higher organization
- Instincts or portions prove irreconcilable and are split off by repression
- If repressed impulses achieve circuitous gratification, success is experienced as pain by ego
- All neurotic pain is "pleasure which cannot be experienced as such"

**Position 9: Two Primary Sources of Pain**
- Perceptual pain: perception of urge of unsatisfied instincts OR external painful/dangerous stimuli
- The psychic apparatus can be guided by pleasure-principle or reality-principle in response
- Most pain experiences don't impugn pleasure-principle supremacy

### THEORY OF TRAUMA AND NEUROSIS

**Position 10: Traumatic Neurosis and Mechanical Shock**
- Traumatic neurosis arises after severe mechanical shock where life danger is involved
- War proved these are not merely organic nerve injury from mechanical force
- Clinical picture approaches hysteria in motor symptoms but shows stronger subjective suffering
- Shows comprehensive general weakening/shattering of mental functions

**Position 11: Fright vs. Fear vs. Apprehension**
- Three terms incorrectly used synonymously but admit clear distinction in relation to danger
- Apprehension (Angst): expectation of danger and preparation, even if unknown
- Fear (Furcht): requires definite object of which one is afraid
- Fright (Schreck): condition when encountering danger without preparation; emphasizes surprise element

**Position 12: Apprehension as Protection Against Trauma**
- Apprehension cannot produce traumatic neurosis
- Apprehension contains something protecting against fright and fright-neurosis
- The element of surprise/lack of preparation is crucial causal factor
- Concurrent physical injury tends to PREVENT neurosis (paradoxically)

**Position 13: Dreams in Traumatic Neurosis Violate Pleasure Principle**
- In traumatic neuroses, dream life continually returns patient to disaster situation with renewed terror
- This contradicts understanding of dreams as wish-fulfillment
- Either dream function suffers dislocation in this condition, OR we must consider masochistic ego tendencies
- These dreams attempt to restore control by developing apprehension retroactively

### THEORY OF REPETITION

**Position 14: Children's Play as Mastery Mechanism**
- Child's play of fort-da (gone-there) game demonstrates repetition of unpleasant experiences
- The 18-month-old repeated mother's departure as game despite its unpleasantness
- Child was passive in experience but active in play repetition
- This may serve impulse to obtain mastery independent of pleasure/pain

**Position 15: Play Transforms Passivity to Activity**
- In play, child applies to playfellow the unpleasant occurrence that befell himself
- Child avenges himself on person of proxy
- This transformation from passivity of experience to activity of play is key mechanism
- Even painful experiences become subjects of play (doctor examining throat)

**Position 16: Repetition-Compulsion in Psychoanalytic Treatment**
- Patient cannot recall all repressed material
- Patient is obliged to REPEAT as current experience instead of recollecting as past fragment
- Reproduction appears with unwelcome fidelity, always contains fragment of infantile sex-life/Oedipus complex
- Played regularly in sphere of transference (relationship to physician)

**Position 17: Earlier Neurosis Replaced by Transference-Neurosis**
- When treatment reaches certain point, earlier neurosis is replaced by fresh transference-neurosis
- Physician limits scope of transference-neurosis, forcing as much as possible into memory
- Different relation between memory and reproduction established for each case
- Success requires some measure of ascendency remains to recognize apparent reality as reflection of forgotten past

**Position 18: Repetition-Compulsion Proceeds from the Repressed**
- The unconscious (repressed material) offers no resistance to cure
- Resistance proceeds from same higher ego levels that originally caused repression
- Repetition-compulsion must be ascribed to repressed element in unconscious
- Could not express itself till treatment loosened repression

**Position 19: Repetition-Compulsion Beyond Pleasure Principle**
- Repetition-compulsion revives past experiences containing no pleasure potentiality
- These could at no time have been satisfactions, even of repressed impulses
- Most of what is revived by repetition-compulsion brings discomfort to ego
- This promotes repressed impulses activities but is pain for one system, satisfaction for another

**Position 20: Normal Life Exhibits Repetition-Compulsion**
- Normal persons show repetition-compulsion in life history
- Gives impression of pursuing fate or daemonic trait in destiny
- Life history appears self-imposed and determined by infantile influences
- Examples: benefactors always betrayed, friendships always ending in treachery, lovers following same relationship pattern

**Position 21: Active vs. Passive Repetition**
- Less astonishing when person's active behavior produces repetition (unalterable character trait)
- More striking when person seems passive, experiencing same fate repeatedly without influence
- Example: woman who married three men who each fell ill and she nursed till death
- Tasso's Tancred unwittingly killing beloved Clorinda twice

**Position 22: Reality of Repetition-Compulsion Established**
- Safe to assume real existence of repetition-compulsion in psychic life going beyond pleasure-principle
- Relates to dreams of shock-patients and children's play-impulse
- Only in rare cases can workings be recognized in pure form without cooperation of other motives

### INSTINCT THEORY AND DEATH DRIVE

**Position 23: Consciousness Not Universal Characteristic**
- Consciousness cannot be most general characteristic of psychic processes but merely special function
- Consciousness yields perceptions from without and feelings of pleasure/pain from within
- System W-Bw (perceptual consciousness) positioned on boundary between outer and inner
- Agrees with localizing tendencies placing consciousness in cortical layer

**Position 24: Memory Traces vs. Consciousness Incompatible**
- Becoming conscious and leaving memory-trace are processes incompatible in same system
- In system Bw, excitation becomes conscious but leaves no lasting trace
- All memory traces relied upon come from propagation to next systems inward
- Consciousness arises in place of memory-trace

**Position 25: System Bw Characteristics from Exposed Position**
- System Bw characterized by excitation not leaving permanent alteration but discharging in becoming conscious
- This departure from general rule requires explanation
- Factor accounting for this is system's exposed situation—immediate contact with outer world
- Analogous to living organism's surface differentiation

**Position 26: The Living Vesicle and Protective Barrier**
- Living substance as undifferentiated vesicle has surface exposed and differentiated by position
- Constant external stimuli impact causes lasting alteration to certain depth
- Forms "rind" burned through by stimulation effects, presenting favorable conditions for reception
- Cannot undergo further modification; elements no longer susceptible to lasting alteration but capable of giving rise to consciousness

**Position 27: Protection Against Stimuli More Important Than Reception**
- For living organism, protection against stimuli almost more important than reception
- Protective barrier equipped with own energy store
- Must protect special forms of energy-transformation within from equalizing/destructive influence of enormous external energies
- Reception serves to collect information about direction/nature of external stimuli in small samples

**Position 28: Time as Mode of System W-Bw Functioning**
- Unconscious mental processes are "timeless"
- Not arranged chronologically; time alters nothing in them; idea of time cannot be applied
- Abstract conception of time derived from mode of functioning of system W-Bw
- Corresponds with self-perception of that system

**Position 29: Inner Excitations Bypass Protective Barrier**
- Toward outer world exists barrier against stimuli reducing excitation effect
- Toward inner, no protection possible; excitations pursue direct path in undiminished mass
- Certain characteristics produce series of pleasure-pain feelings
- Inner excitations more proportionate to system's operation than outer stimuli streaming in

**Position 30: Origin of Projection**
- Two things determined by these conditions: preponderance of pleasure/pain feelings over external stimuli
- Tendency to treat inner excitations bringing overplus of pain as if acting from without
- This allows applying defensive barrier measures against them
- This is origin of projection with important role in pathological states

**Position 31: Trauma Breaks Through Protective Barrier**
- External excitations strong enough to break through barrier against stimuli are "traumatic"
- Concept of trauma involves relationship to otherwise efficacious barrier
- External trauma provokes extensive disturbance in organism's energy working
- Sets in motion every protective measure; pleasure-principle put out of action

**Position 32: Binding Traumatic Stimuli**
- Flooding psychic apparatus with large stimulus masses cannot be prevented after barrier breach
- Another task presents itself: bring stimulus under control, "bind" stimulus mass in psyche
- This enables discharge
- Specific discomfort of bodily pain results from local breaking through of protective barrier

**Position 33: Counter-Charge Mechanism**
- From all sides "charging energy" called on to create correspondingly high "charges" around breach
- Immense "counter-charge" set up, impoverishing other psychic systems
- Wide-spread paralysis/diminution of other psychic activity follows
- This demonstrates even highly charged system can receive new energy streaming in

**Position 34: Binding Force Proportionate to Quiescent Charge**
- The more intense intrinsic quiescent charge, the greater binding force
- The lower system's charge, the less capable of receiving streaming energy
- Therefore more violent consequences when barrier broken through
- Not valid objection that intensifying charges is merely direct action of excitation mass

**Position 35: Free-Flowing vs. Quiescent Energy Distinction**
- Must distinguish two ways system may be filled with energy (Breuer's proposition)
- Difference between "charging" that is free-flowing/striving for discharge vs. quiescent
- May admit conjecture that binding energy streaming into psychic apparatus consists in translating from free-flowing to quiescent state
- This distinction fundamental to metapsychology

**Position 36: Traumatic Neurosis as Barrier Rupture**
- May regard ordinary traumatic neurosis as result of extensive rupture of barrier against stimuli
- Old naïve "shock" doctrine comes into its own, apparently opposing later psychological view
- Psychoanalytic conception far from identical with crudest shock theory
- Seeks to understand effect through breaking barrier and consequent tasks

**Position 37: Fright as Failure of Preparation**
- Fright retains meaning as failure of apprehension mechanism to make proper preparation
- Including over-charging of systems first receiving stimulus
- Due to lower charging degree, systems hardly able to bind oncoming excitation masses
- Apprehensive preparation with over-charging represents last line of defense against stimuli

**Position 38: Dreams Re-establish Preparation Retroactively**
- Dreams of traumatic neurosis patients regularly returning to disaster don't serve wish-fulfillment
- Serve another purpose that must be fulfilled before pleasure-principle can begin sway
- Attempts at restoring control by developing apprehension (pretermission caused neurosis)
- Affords insight into function independent of pleasure-principle, of earlier origin than attaining pleasure

**Position 39: First Exception to Dream Wish-Fulfillment**
- Moment to concede first exception to principle that dream is wish-fulfillment
- Anxiety dreams are no exception (repeatedly shown)
- Punishment dreams are wish-fulfillment of guilt sense
- But traumatic neurosis dreams and childhood trauma recall dreams in analysis don't permit wish-fulfillment classification

**Position 40: Dreams May Have Prehistoric Past Function**
- Function of dream to remove motives interrupting sleep by wish-fulfillments not its original function
- Could secure this control only after whole psychic life accepted pleasure-principle domination
- If there is "beyond the pleasure-principle," logical to admit prehistoric past for wish-fulfilling dream tendency
- No contradiction of later function when this tendency broken through

### SPECULATIVE BIOLOGY AND INSTINCT ORIGINS

**Position 41: Instinct as Conservative Tendency**
- An instinct is tendency innate in living organic matter impelling toward reinstatement of earlier condition
- One which it had to abandon under external disturbing forces
- A kind of organic elasticity or manifestation of inertia in organic life
- This conception seems strange since we usually see instinct as urging toward change/development

**Position 42: Evidence from Animal Behavior**
- Fish undertaking arduous journeys at spawning to reach earlier homes of their kind
- Migratory flights of birds of passage seeking earlier habitats
- These appear to confirm instinct as historically conditioned
- Heredity and embryology provide imposing proofs of organic compulsion to repetition

**Position 43: Embryonic Development as Repetition**
- Germ cell obliged to repeat in development structures of all ancestral forms
- Though in fleeting/curtailed fashion instead of hastening to final shape
- Mechanical explanation impossible except in trifling particulars
- Historical explanation cannot be disregarded

**Position 44: Regeneration as Conservative Instinct**
- Power of reproduction extends far up animal kingdom
- Lost organ replaced by growth of new one exactly like it
- Demonstrates conservative tendency in organic matter

**Position 45: All Instincts Aim at Earlier Condition**
- If all instincts have as aim reinstatement of earlier condition
- All results of organic development must be credited to external disturbing/distracting influences
- Rudimentary creature would not have wanted to change from beginning
- Would merely repeat same existence course if circumstances remained same

**Position 46: Evolution Result of External Forces**
- Evolution of earth and relation to sun left imprint on organism development
- Conservative organic instincts absorbed all enforced alterations in life course
- Stored them for repetition
- Present delusive appearance of forces striving for change/progress while merely seeking old goal by old and new ways

**Position 47: The Goal of Life is Death**
- Final goal of all organic striving can be stated
- Would be counter to conservative instinct nature if goal were state never hitherto reached
- Must be ancient starting point which living being left long ago
- If we assume everything living dies from internal causes and returns to inorganic
- "The goal of all life is death" and "The inanimate was there before the animate"

**Position 48: Origin of Life as Awakening of Properties**
- At some time, by operation of force still completely baffling
- Properties of life awakened in lifeless matter
- Perhaps process resembled later arising of consciousness in living matter stratum
- Tension aroused in previously inanimate matter strove to attain equilibrium

**Position 49: First Instinct Was to Return to Lifelessness**
- The first instinct present was to return to lifelessness
- Living substance at that time had death within easy reach
- Probably only short life course to run, determined by chemical structure
- Through long period, living substance constantly created anew and easily extinguished

**Position 50: Circuitous Routes to Death**
- Decisive external influences altered surviving substance
- Compelled ever greater deviations from original life path
- Ever more complicated/circuitous routes to attainment of death goal
- These circuitous ways to death, retained by conservative instincts, are phenomena of life as we know it

**Position 51: Self-Preservation Instincts as Paths to Death**
- If exclusively conservative nature of instincts accepted as true
- Self-preservative instincts stand in remarkable contrast to supposition that whole life serves bringing death
- Theoretic significance of self-preservation/power/self-assertion instincts shrinks to nothing
- They are part-instincts designed to secure peculiar path to death and ward off other possibilities

**Position 52: Organism Resolved to Die Only Its Own Way**
- Organism resolved to die only in its own way
- Even these watchmen of life were originally myrmidons of death
- Paradox: living organism resists with all energy influences (dangers) that could help reach life-goal by short way
- This just the behavior characterizing pure instinct as contrasted with intelligent striving

**Position 53: Sexual Instincts as Exception**
- Sexual instincts lead to quite another point of view
- Not all organisms yielded to external compulsion driving toward ever further development
- Many maintained themselves on low level up to present time
- Not all elementary organisms making up higher life form take part in whole path to natural end (death)

**Position 54: Reproductive Cells Retain Original Structure**
- Reproductive cells probably retain original structure of living substance
- After given time, detach from parent organism
- Charged with all inherited and newly acquired instinctive dispositions
- Under favorable conditions begin to develop—repeat cycle to which they owe origin

**Position 55: Germ Cells Operate Against Death**
- One portion of substance carries development to finish
- Another portion as new germinal core harks back to beginning of development
- Reproductive cells operate against death of living substance
- Able to win what seems potential immortality (perhaps only lengthening path to death)

**Position 56: Fortification Through Mingling**
- Of highest significance: reproductive cell fortified for function or becomes capable only by mingling with another like yet different
- Germ cells care for destinies of elementary organisms surviving individual
- Concern themselves with safe sheltering while defenseless
- Finally bring about conjunction with other reproductive cells

**Position 57: Sexual Instincts as Specially Conservative**
- Sexual instincts conservative in same sense as others (reproduce earlier conditions)
- Conservative in higher degree: specially resistant to external influences
- More conservative in wider sense: preserve life itself for longer time
- They are actual life-instincts

**Position 58: Contradiction Between Life and Death Instincts**
- Fact that sexual instincts run counter to trend of other instincts leading toward death indicates contradiction
- This contradiction recognized by theory of neuroses as full of significance
- Oscillating rhythm in life of organisms: one group presses forward to final goal quickly
- Other flies back at certain point to traverse same stretch again, prolonging journey duration

**Position 59: Sexuality Not Present at Dawn of Life**
- Although sexuality and sex distinction certainly didn't exist at dawn of life
- Remains possible that instincts later described as sexual were active from very beginning
- Took up part of opposition to role of ego-instincts then, not only at later time

**Position 60: No General Impulse Toward Higher Development**
- Apart from sexual instincts, are there really no other instincts than those with object of reinstating earlier condition?
- Not aware of satisfactory example in organic world running counter to suggested characteristic
- Existence of general impulse toward higher development cannot be established
- Though some such development line is unquestionable as fact

**Position 61: Higher Development Often Balanced by Retrogression**
- Often merely question of our own valuation when we pronounce one stage higher than another
- Biology makes clear higher development in one particular often purchased/balanced by retrogression in another
- Plenty of animal forms whose youthful stages teach their development took retrograde character
- Higher development and retrogression alike might be results of external forces impelling toward adaptation

**Position 62: No Impulse Toward Perfection in Man**
- Many find it hard to abandon belief that in man dwells impulse toward perfection
- Which brought him to present intellectual/ethical heights
- From which development into superman might be expected
- But I do not believe in existence of such inner impulse

**Position 63: Striving for Perfection as Repression Effect**
- Development of man doesn't seem to need explanation differing from animal development
- Restless striving toward further perfection observable in minority easily explicable as result of instinct repression
- What is most valuable in human culture built on repression of instinct
- Repressed instinct never ceases striving after complete satisfaction

**Position 64: Excess Demand Creates Driving Momentum**
- Complete satisfaction would consist in repetition of primary experience of satisfaction
- All substitution/reaction-formations and sublimations avail nothing toward relaxing continual tension
- Out of excess of satisfaction demanded over that found is born driving momentum
- Allows no abiding in any situation presented, "urges ever forward, ever unsubdued" (Mephisto)

**Position 65: Path Back to Satisfaction Generally Barred**
- Path in other direction, back to complete satisfaction, usually barred by resistances maintaining repressions
- Nothing remains but to proceed in other still unobstructed direction of development
- Without prospect of bringing process to conclusion or attaining goal
- What occurs in neurotic phobia development (attempt at flight from instinct satisfaction) gives prototype

**Position 66: Impulse Toward Perfection Not Universal**
- Cannot possibly ascribe ostensible impulse toward perfection to all human beings
- Dynamic conditions quite generally present
- But economic relations seem only in rare cases to favor phenomenon
- This is why we cannot ascribe it universally

### REVISED DUALISTIC INSTINCT THEORY

**Position 67: Sharp Antithesis: Ego-Instincts vs. Sexual Instincts**
- Discussion results in sharp antithesis between ego-instincts and sexual instincts
- Former impelling toward death, latter toward life preservation
- Result we ourselves must find far from adequate in many respects
- Only for former can we claim conservative/regressive character corresponding to repetition-compulsion

**Position 68: Ego-Instincts Spring from Vitalizing Inanimate Matter**
- According to hypothesis, ego-instincts spring from vitalizing of inanimate matter
- Have as their aim reinstatement of lifelessness
- As to sexual instincts: obvious they reproduce primitive states of living being

**Position 69: Sexual Union as Condition for Immortality**
- Aim sexual instincts strive for by every means is union of two specifically differentiated germ cells
- If this union doesn't take place, germ cell dies like all other elements of multicellular organism
- Only on this condition can sexual function prolong life and lend semblance of immortality

**Position 70: Question of What Sexual Reproduction Repeats**
- Of what important happening in living substance development is sexual reproduction/copulation the repetition?
- Do not know how to answer this question
- Would feel relieved if whole argument structure proved erroneous
- Opposition of ego-(death-)instincts and sexual (life-)instincts would then disappear

**Position 71: Testing Natural Death Assumption**
- Turn back to assumption that all life must die from internal causes
- Made this assumption light-heartedly because it doesn't seem to be one
- Accustomed to think so; every poet encourages idea
- Perhaps resolved to think so because there lies certain consolation in belief

**Position 72: Natural Death May Be Illusion**
- Perhaps belief in death as necessary consequence of inner law is illusion fashioned to endure burden of existence
- Certainly not primordial belief
- Idea of "natural death" alien to primitive races; they ascribe every death to enemy or evil spirit influence
- So let us turn to biological science to test belief

**Position 73: Little Agreement Among Biologists on Death**
- May be astonished to find how little agreement exists among biologists on natural death question
- Very conception of death altogether eludes them
- Certain average life length among higher animals argues for death from inner causes
- But circumstance that certain large animals/giant trees reach very great age removes this impression

**Position 74: Weismann's Mortal Soma vs. Immortal Germ-Plasm**
- Weismann originated distinction of living substance into mortal and immortal half
- Mortal is body in narrower sense (soma), alone subject to natural death
- Germ cells potentially immortal insofar as capable of developing into new individual under favorable conditions
- Can surround themselves with new soma

**Position 75: Weismann's Differentiation Only for Multicellular Organisms**
- Weismann admits differentiation between mortal soma and immortal germ-plasm only for multicellular organisms
- With unicellular beings, individual and reproductive cell still one and same
- Unicellular he affirms to be potentially immortal
- Death appears only among metazoa (multicellular)

**Position 76: Death as Purposive Contrivance for Multicellular**
- This death of higher organisms is natural death from inner causes
- But doesn't depend on inherent quality of living substance
- Not to be conceived as absolute necessity based on nature of life
- Rather purposive contrivance, phenomenon of adaptation to external life conditions

**Position 77: Death Became Possible and Expedient**
- After differentiation of corporeal cells into soma and germ-plasm
- Indefinite prolongation of individual life would have become quite inexpedient luxury
- With appearance of this differentiation, death became possible and expedient
- Since then soma dies after certain time from internal causes

**Position 78: Propagation Not Introduced With Death**
- Propagation not first introduced with death
- On contrary, is primordial property of living matter like growth, from which it originated
- Life has gone on uninterruptedly from inception on earth

**Position 79: Late Death Doesn't Help Death Instinct Theory**
- To concede natural death to higher organisms doesn't greatly help our case
- If death is late acquisition of life, then death instincts traceable to beginning no longer come into question
- Multicellular organisms may continue to die from internal causes (defect of differentiation or metabolism imperfections)
- Such conception/derivation more nearly approaches ordinary human view than unwonted assumption of death-instincts

**Position 80: Debate Over Weismann Not Decisive**
- Discussion centered round Weismann's assertions has had no decisive result in any direction
- Many writers reverted to Goette's standpoint (1883) seeing in death direct consequence of propagation
- Hartmann doesn't regard appearance of corpse as death characteristic
- Defines it as "definitive end of individual development"

**Position 81: Protozoa Also Subject to Death**
- In Hartmann's sense, protozoa also subject to death
- With them death invariably coincides with propagation
- But is so to speak disguised by latter
- Whole substance of parent organism may be absorbed directly into new individuals

**Position 82: Woodruff's Immortality Experiment**
- American Woodruff instituted culture of ciliated infusorium (slipper-animalcule)
- Reproduces by division into two individuals
- Traced propagation to 3029th generation when discontinued experiment
- Last descendant just as lively as original ancestor without sign of age/degeneration
- If such numbers convincing, immortality of protozoa seemed experimentally demonstrable

**Position 83: Contradictory Findings on Protozoa Aging**
- Other investigators (Maupas, Calkins) found contradicting Woodruff
- Even these infusoria after certain divisions become weaker, decrease in size
- Lose portion of organization, finally die without invigorating influences
- According to this, protozoa die after senile decay phase like higher animals
- In direct contravention of Weismann's view

**Position 84: Conjugation Prevents Aging**
- First fact affording firm foothold: if animalculae have opportunity to mingle (conjugate) when showing no age signs
- Afterwards again separating, they remain exempt from age, are "rejuvenated"
- Conjugation doubtless prototype of sexual propagation of higher organisms
- As yet nothing to do with multiplication; confined to mingling of both individuals' substances

**Position 85: Invigorating Influence Can Be Replaced**
- Invigorating influence of conjugation can be replaced by certain stimulation modes
- Changes in nutrient fluid composition, raising temperature, or shaking
- J. Loeb's famous experiment: applying chemical stimuli to sea-urchin ova
- Brought about division processes usually taking place only after fertilization

**Position 86: Infusoria Die From Own Metabolic Products**
- Probable that infusoria brought to natural death through own vital process
- Contradiction between Woodruff and others arises from Woodruff placing each generation in fresh nutrient
- When he refrained, observed same aging signs as other investigators
- Concluded animalculae injured by metabolism products given off into surrounding fluid

**Position 87: Own Metabolic Products Fatal**
- Able to prove convincingly only products of its OWN metabolism had death-bringing effect
- For in solution over-saturated with distantly related species waste products
- Very same animalculae throve excellently which in own nutrient inevitably perished
- Thus left to itself, infusorium dies natural death from imperfect disposal of own metabolic products

**Position 88: All Higher Animals Die From Same Inability**
- Perhaps all higher animals die ultimately from same inability
- To dispose of their own metabolic products
- This suggests universal mechanism of natural death

**Position 89: Doubt About Studying Death in Protozoa**
- Doubt may occur whether good purpose served looking for natural death answer in protozoa study
- Primitive organization of these life forms may conceal important conditions
- Present in them too but recognizable only among higher animals where they achieved morphological expression

**Position 90: Dynamic vs. Morphological Point of View**
- If we abandon morphological point of view for dynamic
- May be matter of entire indifference whether natural death of protozoa can be proved
- With them substance later recognized as immortal not yet separated from part subject to death

**Position 91: Death-Instincts May Be Active from Beginning**
- Instinctive forces endeavoring to conduct life to death might be active in protozoa from beginning
- Yet their effect might be so obscured by life-preserving forces
- That direct evidence of existence becomes hard to establish
- Biologist observations allow us to assume such death-ward tending inner processes even among protozoa

**Position 92: Even Protozoa Immortality Doesn't Invalidate Hypothesis**
- Even if protozoa prove immortal in Weismann's sense
- His assertion that death is late acquisition holds good only of outward death manifestations
- Doesn't invalidate hypothesis of processes impelling toward death
- Our expectation that biology would entirely discount death-instincts recognition not fulfilled

**Position 93: Weismann Distinction Resemblance Remains Unshaken**
- Striking resemblance between Weismann's separation of soma/germ-plasm and our distinction between death/life-instincts remains unshaken
- Retains its value despite other considerations
- Fundamental analogy persists

**Position 94: Hering's Anabolic vs. Katabolic Processes**
- According to E. Hering's theory of processes in living matter
- Course through it uninterruptedly two kinds of processes of opposite direction
- One anabolic/assimilatory, other katabolic/disintegrating
- Shall we venture to recognize in these two directions activity of our two instinctive tendencies?

**Position 95: Convergence with Schopenhauer**
- Cannot disguise that we steered unawares into haven of Schopenhauer's philosophy
- For whom death is "real result" of life and therefore in so far its aim
- While sexual instinct is incarnation of will to live
- This convergence noteworthy

**Position 96: Multicellularity as Life-Prolongation Means**
- According to general opinion, union of numerous cells into one vital connection (multicellularity of organisms)
- Has become means to prolongation of their life span
- One cell helps preserve life of others
- Cell-community can go on living even if single cells perish

**Position 97: Conjugation Has Preservative/Rejuvenating Effect**
- Also conjugation (temporary mingling of two unicellular entities)
- Has preservative and rejuvenating effect on both
- Attempt might be made to transfer Libido theory from psychoanalysis to cell relationships

**Position 98: Libido Theory Applied to Cells**
- Might imagine vital/sexual instincts active in every cell
- Take other cells for their "object"
- Partially neutralize their death-instincts (processes stimulated by these)
- So preserve those cells in life
- While other cells do same for them, and still others sacrifice themselves in exercise of libidinous function

**Position 99: Germ Cells Behave Narcissistically**
- Germ cells themselves would behave in completely "narcissistic" fashion
- As accustomed to describe in neuroses theory when individual concentrates libido on ego
- Gives out none for charging objects
- Need their libido—activity of vital instincts—for themselves as provision for later enormous constructive activity

**Position 100: Malignant Growths as Narcissistic**
- Perhaps cells of malignant growths destroying organism can also be considered narcissistic in same sense
- Pathology prepared to regard kernels of them as congenital in origin
- Ascribe embryonal attributes to them
- Thus Libido of sexual instincts would coincide with Eros of poets/philosophers holding together all things living

### DEVELOPMENT OF LIBIDO THEORY

**Position 101: Initial Opposition: Sexual vs. Ego-Instincts**
- Analysis of transference-neuroses forced notice first of opposition between sexual instincts directed toward object
- And other instincts only imperfectly discerned, provisionally described as ego-instincts
- Among latter, those subserving individual self-preservation had first claim for recognition

**Position 102: Psychoanalysis Adhered to "Hunger and Love"**
- Psychoanalysis could not dispense with some hypothesis as to instincts
- Adhered to begin with to popular distinction typically represented by phrase "hunger and love"
- At least no new arbitrary creation
- With this adequately covered considerable distance in psychoneuroses analysis

**Position 103: Extension of Sexuality Concept**
- Conception of "sexuality"—and therewith of sexual instinct—certainly had to be extended
- Till it included much not coming into category of propagation function
- This led to outcry enough in severe/superior or merely hypocritical world

**Position 104: Psychoanalysis Approached Psychological Ego**
- Next step followed when Psychoanalysis able to feel way nearer to psychological ego
- At first known only as repressing, censoring agency
- Capable of constituting defenses and reaction-formations

**Position 105: Objections to Narrow Libido Concept**
- Critical and far-seeing minds long raised objections to narrowing libido concept to sexual instinct energy directed to object
- But they omitted to say whence they obtained fuller comprehension
- Failed to deduce anything from it of value for Psychoanalysis

**Position 106: Libido Withdrawn from Object to Ego**
- In course of more deliberate advance came under observation how regularly libido withdrawn from object and directed toward ego (introversion)
- Through study of child's libido-development in earliest phases became clear
- Ego is true and original reservoir of libido, extended to object only from this

**Position 107: Ego as Sexual Object**
- Ego took its place as one of sexual objects
- Was immediately recognized as choicest among them
- Where libido thus remained attached to ego it was termed "narcissistic"

**Position 108: Narcissistic Libido as Sexual Instinct Energy**
- This narcissistic libido naturally also expression of sexual instincts energy in analytical sense
- Which now had to be identified with "instincts of self-preservation" admitted from first
- Whereupon original antithesis between ego-instincts and sexual instincts became inadequate

**Position 109: Part of Ego-Instincts Recognized as Libidinous**
- Part of ego-instincts recognized as libidinous
- In ego sexual instincts found to be active—probably in addition to others
- Nevertheless justified in saying old formula still valid: psychoneurosis arises from conflict between ego-instincts and sexual instincts

**Position 110: Difference Now Topographical, Not Qualitative**
- Difference of two kinds of instincts supposed originally qualitative
- Has now to be defined otherwise, namely on topographical basis
- Particularly transference-neurosis still seen as result of conflict between ego and libidinous investment of object

**Position 111: Accentuating Libidinous Character of Self-Preservation**
- More compelled now to accentuate libidinous character of self-preservative instincts
- Since venturing further step of recognizing sexual instinct as Eros, all-sustaining
- Deriving narcissistic libido of ego from sum of libido quantities bringing about mutual adherence of somatic cells

**Position 112: Risk of Having Only Libidinous Instincts**
- Now find ourselves suddenly confronted with question
- If self-preservative instincts also of libidinous kind, then perhaps we have no other instincts at all than libidinous ones
- At least no others apparent
- Then must admit critics right who suspected psychoanalysis makes sexuality explanation of everything

**Position 113: Result Not Intended**
- This result at all events one not intended by us
- On contrary, took as starting point sharp distinction between ego-instincts (=death-instincts) and sexual instincts (=life-instincts)
- Were prepared to reckon even alleged self-preservative instincts among death-instincts (position since corrected/withdrawn)

**Position 114: Dualistic Standpoint Maintained**
- Our standpoint was dualistic from beginning, and is so today more sharply than before
- Since we no longer call contrasting tendencies egoistic and sexual instincts
- But life-instincts and death-instincts
- Jung's libido theory on other hand is monistic

**Position 115: Jung's Monistic Confusion**
- Jung applied term libido to his only instinctive energy
- Was bound to create confusion but should have no further effect on us
- We suspect there are in ego other instincts than those of self-preservation
- Only we ought to be in position to demonstrate them

**Position 116: Analysis of Ego Progress Insufficient**
- Unfortunately so little progress made in analysis of ego
- That this proof becomes extraordinarily difficult of attainment
- Libidinous instincts of ego may indeed be conjoined in special way with other ego-instincts of which we yet know nothing

**Position 117: Narcissism Conjecture Already Present**
- Before ever we clearly recognized narcissism
- Conjecture was already present in psychoanalysts' minds that ego-instincts had drawn libidinous components to themselves
- But these merely vague possibilities which opponents will hardly take into account

**Position 118: Analysis Only Demonstrates Libidinous Impulses**
- Remains awkward fact that analysis up to now only put us in position of demonstrating libidinous impulses
- Conclusion that therefore there are no others is one to which we do not assent
- Present inability to demonstrate doesn't prove non-existence

**Position 119: New Polarity: Love (Tenderness) vs. Hate (Aggression)**
- In obscurity shrouding instinct theory, shall not do well to reject idea promising light
- Have made antithesis between life and death-instincts our point of departure
- Object-love itself displays second polarity: that of love (tenderness) and hate (aggression)

**Position 120: Sadism as Death-Instinct Component**
- What if we could succeed in relating these two polarities to each other?
- Have long recognized sadistic component of sexual instinct
- Can attain independence and as perversion dominate whole sexual trend
- In one pregenital organization appears as dominating part-instinct

**Position 121: Sadism Derived from Death-Instinct**
- How derive sadistic impulse (aims at object injury) from life-sustaining Eros?
- Assumption suggests itself that this sadism properly death-instinct
- Driven apart from ego by influence of narcissistic libido
- So becomes manifest only in reference to object
- Then enters service of sexual function

**Position 122: Sadism's Progressive Role in Sexuality**
- At oral stage of libido organization, amorous possession still one with annihilation of object
- Later sadistic impulse separates itself
- At stage of genital primacy takes over function of so far overpowering sex-object as sexual act carrying out demands
- Might even say sadism expelled from ego acted as guide to libidinous components of sexual instinct

**Position 123: Hate-Love Ambivalence Setup**
- Where original sadism experiences no abatement or fusion
- Well-known hate-love ambivalence of love-life is set up
- This provides example of death-instinct though displaced one

**Position 124: Masochism as Return to Earlier Phase**
- Conception not evident, creates mystical impression
- May appear we attempted at all costs to find way out of impasse
- But assumption is no new one; we made it once before when no question of impasse
- Clinical observations forced view that masochism (part-instinct complementary to sadism) is to be understood as recoil of sadism on ego itself

**Position 125: Masochism May Be Primary**
- Turning instinct from object to ego is essentially same as turning from ego to object (new idea in question)
- Masochism (turning instinct against self) would then be in reality return to earlier phase of this, regression
- Exposition then given of masochism needs correction: masochism may also be primary (what was there concerned to deny)

**Position 126: Conjugation Effect as Prototype**
- Return to life-sustaining sexual instincts
- Already learned from protozoa investigation that mingling of two individuals without consequent partition
- Just as copulation between two separating soon after, has strengthening/rejuvenating effect
- No sign of degeneration in descendants
- Seem to have gained capacity for withstanding longer time injurious results of own metabolism

**Position 127: Blending Introduces New Stimulus Masses**
- This one observation may be taken as prototype of sexual intercourse effect also
- But in what way does blending of two slightly different cells bring about life renewal?
- Experiment substituting for conjugation effect of chemical/even mechanical stimuli admits reply with certainty
- Comes about by introduction of new stimulus masses

**Position 128: Union Increases Chemical Tensions**
- This closely agrees with hypothesis that life-process of individual leads from internal causes to equalizing of chemical tensions (i.e., to death)
- While union with individually different living substance increases these tensions
- So to speak introduces new vital differentia which then have to be again lived out

**Position 129: Nirvana-Principle Recognition**
- For this difference between two there must naturally be one or more optima
- Our recognition that ruling tendency of psychic life, perhaps nerve life altogether
- Is struggle for reduction, keeping at constant level, or removal of inner stimulus tension (Nirvana-principle, as Barbara Low terms it)
- Struggle comes to expression in pleasure-principle
- Indeed one of our strongest motives for believing in death-instincts existence

**Position 130: Sexual Instinct Lacks Repetition-Compulsion Character**
- But course of argument still disturbed by uneasy feeling
- That just in case of sexual instinct unable to demonstrate repetition-compulsion character
- Which first put us on death-instincts track
- True that realm of embryonic developmental processes offers abundance of such repetition phenomena

**Position 131: Germ Cells as Repetitions**
- Two germ cells of sexual propagation and their life history themselves only repetitions of organic life beginning
- But essential feature in processes designed by sexual instinct is nevertheless mingling of two cells
- Only by this is immortality of living substance among higher life forms assured

**Position 132: Must Enquire into Sexual Propagation Origin**
- Must make enquiry into origin of sexual propagation and source of sexual instincts in general
- Task before which lay mind quails and even specialists have not yet been able to solve
- Let us make condensed selection from conflicting accounts of whatever can be brought into relation with our train of thought

**Position 133: Sex as Advantageous Amphimixis Utilization**
- One view deprives propagation problem of mysterious attraction
- By representing it as part of growth phenomenon (multiplication by division, germination, budding)
- Arising of propagation by means of sexually differentiated germ cells might be conceived
- In accordance with sober Darwinian mode of thought, as way of maintaining/utilizing for further development advantage of amphimixis

**Position 134: Amphimixis from Fortuitous Conjugation**
- Which resulted in first instance from fortuitous conjugation of two protozoa
- "Sex" would not thus be of very ancient origin
- Extraordinarily powerful instincts aiming at bringing about sexual union would thereby repeat something which once chanced to happen
- Since became established as being advantageous

**Position 135: Same Question Recurs for Sex as for Death**
- Same question now recurs as arose in respect of death
- Whether protozoa can be credited with anything beyond what they exhibit
- Whether may assume forces/processes becoming perceptible only in higher animals did first arise in more primitive
- For our purpose, view of sexuality mentioned above helps very little

**Position 136: Objection: Presupposes Life-Instincts from Beginning**
- Objection may be raised that it presupposes existence of life-instincts as already operative in simplest life forms
- For otherwise conjugation working against life expiration and making dying task harder
- Would not have been retained and elaborated, but would have been avoided
- If not to abandon death-instincts hypothesis, must associate them with life-instincts from beginning

**Position 137: Working with Two Unknown Quantities**
- But must admit we are working here at equation with two unknown quantities
- Anything else science can tell of sexuality origin amounts to so little
- That this problem may be likened to obscurity into which not even ray of hypothesis has penetrated

**Position 138: Plato's Aristophanes Myth**
- In quite another quarter encounter such hypothesis
- But of so fantastic kind—assuredly myth rather than scientific explanation—that I should not venture to bring it forward
- If it did not exactly fulfill one condition for fulfillment of which we are laboring
- That is to say, it derives instinct from necessity for reinstatement of earlier situation

**Position 139: Plato's Three Original Sexes**
- Refer to theory Plato in Symposium puts into Aristophanes' mouth
- Deals not only with origin of sexual instinct but also with most important variations in relation to object
- "Human nature was once quite other than now. Originally there were three sexes, three and not as today two"
- Besides male and female existed third sex having equal share in two first

**Position 140: Zeus Divided Original Beings**
- "In these beings everything was double: thus, they had four hands and four feet, two faces, two genital parts, and so on"
- Then Zeus allowed himself to be persuaded to cut these beings in two, as one divides pears to stew them
- "When all nature was divided in this way, to each human being came longing for his own other half"
- "And two halves embraced and entwined their bodies and desired to grow together again"

**Position 141: Daring Assumption of Original Rent**
- Are we to follow clue of poet-philosopher and make daring assumption
- That living substance at time of animation rent into small particles
- Which since that time strive for reunion by means of sexual instincts?

**Position 142: Sexual Instincts Continue Chemical Affinity**
- That these instincts—in which chemical affinity of inanimate matter is continued
- Passing through realm of protozoa gradually overcome all hindrances set to striving
- By environment charged with stimuli dangerous to life, impelled by it to form protecting covering layer

**Position 143: Dispersed Fragments Achieve Multicellular Organization**
- And that these dispersed fragments of living substance thus achieve multicellular organisation
- Finally transfer to germ cells in highly concentrated form the instinct for reunion
- I think this is point at which to break off

### METHODOLOGICAL REFLECTIONS

**Position 144: Uncertainty About Personal Conviction**
- Might be asked whether I am myself convinced of views here set forward, and if so how far
- My answer would be that I am neither convinced myself, nor am I seeking to arouse conviction in others
- More accurately: I do not know how far I believe in them
- Seems to me affective feature "conviction" need not come into consideration at all here

**Position 145: Following Thought as Scientific Curiosity**
- One may surely give oneself up to line of thought, and follow it up as far as it leads
- Simply out of scientific curiosity, or—if you prefer—as advocatus diaboli
- Without however making pact with devil about it

**Position 146: Third Step Less Certain Than First Two**
- Perfectly aware that third step in instinct theory which I am taking here cannot claim same certainty as two former ones
- Viz., extending conception of sexuality and establishing of narcissism
- These innovations were direct translations of observation into theory
- Subject to no greater sources of error than is inevitable in anything of kind

**Position 147: Regressive Instinct Character Based on Observation**
- Assertion of regressive character of instinct rests also on observed material
- Namely on facts of repetition-compulsion
- But perhaps I have over-estimated their significance
- At all events no way of working out this idea except by combining facts with pure imagination many times in succession

**Position 148: Departing Far From Observation**
- Thereby departing far from observation
- We know final result becomes more untrustworthy the oftener one does this in building theory
- But precise degree of uncertainty not ascertainable
- One may thereby have made brilliant discovery or gone ignominiously astray

**Position 149: Distrust of Intuition**
- In such work I trust little to so-called intuition
- What I have seen of it seems to me result of certain impartiality of intellect
- Only that people unfortunately seldom impartial where concerned with ultimate things, great problems of science and life

**Position 150: Deep-Rooted Preferences Control Speculation**
- My belief is that there everyone is under sway of preferences deeply rooted within
- Into hands of which he unwittingly plays as he pursues speculation
- Where there are such good grounds for distrust, only tepid feeling of indulgence possible toward results of own mental labors

**Position 151: Self-Criticism Doesn't Require Tolerance**
- But hasten to add such self-criticism does not render obligatory any special tolerance of divergent opinions
- One may inexorably reject theories contradicted by very first steps in observation analysis
- Yet at same time be aware that those one holds oneself have only tentative validity

**Position 152: No Disturbance from Surprising Processes**
- Were we to appraise our speculations upon life and death-instincts
- Would disturb us but little that so many processes go on which are surprising and hard to picture
- Such as one instinct being expelled by others, or turning from ego to object, and so on

**Position 153: Obliged to Use Metaphorical Language**
- This comes only from our being obliged to operate with scientific terms
- i.e., with metaphorical expressions peculiar to psychology (or more correctly: psychology of deeper layers)
- Otherwise we should not be able to describe corresponding processes at all, nor even have remarked them

**Position 154: Psychological Terms Are Metaphors**
- Shortcomings of our description would probably disappear if for psychological terms we could substitute physiological or chemical ones
- These too only constitute metaphorical language, but one familiar to us for much longer time
- Perhaps also simpler

**Position 155: Biology May Overthrow Hypothesis Structure**
- Uncertainty of our speculation enhanced in high degree by necessity of borrowing from biological science
- Biology truly realm of limitless possibilities
- Have most surprising revelations to expect from it
- Cannot conjecture what answers it will offer in some decades to questions we have put to it

**Position 156: Perhaps Overthrow Whole Structure**
- Perhaps they may be such as to overthrow whole artificial structure of hypotheses
- If that is so, someone may ask why does one undertake such work and why should it be communicated to world?
- Well, I cannot deny that some of analogies, relations and connections therein traced appeared to me worthy of consideration

### FUNCTION AND TENDENCY DISTINCTION

**Position 157: Distinguish Function from Tendency**
- Let us distinguish function and tendency more sharply than we have hitherto done
- Pleasure-principle is then tendency which subserves certain function
- Namely, that of rendering psychic apparatus as whole free from any excitation
- Or to keep amount of excitation constant or as low as possible

**Position 158: Cannot Yet Decide Between Conceptions**
- Cannot yet decide with certainty for either of these conceptions
- But note that function so defined would partake of most universal tendency of all living matter
- To return to peace of inorganic world

**Position 159: Greatest Pleasure in Temporary Quenching**
- We all know by experience that greatest pleasure possible for us to attain
- That of sexual act, is bound up with temporary quenching of greatly heightened excitation state
- Binding of instinct-excitation would be preparatory function directing excitation toward ultimate adjustment in pleasure of discharge

**Position 160: Bound vs. Unbound Processes and Sensation**
- Question arises whether sensations of pleasure and pain can emanate as well from bound as from unbound excitation processes
- Appears quite beyond doubt that unbound/primary processes give rise to much more intense sensations in both directions than bound/secondary processes

**Position 161: Primary Processes Earlier in Time**
- Primary processes also earlier in point of time
- At beginning of mental life there are no others
- May conclude that if pleasure-principle were not already in action in respect to them
- It would not establish itself in regard to later processes

**Position 162: Search for Pleasure More Intense at Beginning**
- Thus arrive at result which at bottom not simple one
- That search for pleasure manifests itself with far greater intensity at beginning of psychic life than later on
- But less unrestrictedly; it has to put up with repeated breaches

**Position 163: Dominance More Assured at Maturity**
- At maturer age dominance of pleasure-principle very much more assured
- Though this principle as little escapes limitations as all other instincts
- In any case, whatever it is in excitation process that engenders pleasure/pain sensations
- Must be equally in existence when secondary process at work as with primary process

**Position 164: Further Studies Required on Tension**
- This would seem place to institute further studies
- Our consciousness conveys from within not only sensations of pleasure and pain
- But also those of peculiar tension, which again may be either pleasurable or painful in itself

**Position 165: Questions About Bound/Unbound and Tension**
- Now is it bound and unbound energy processes we have to distinguish by help of these sensations?
- Or is sensation of tension to be related to absolute quantity, perhaps to level of charge
- While pleasure-pain series refers to changes in quantity of charge in unit of time?

**Position 166: Life-Instincts Appear as Disturbers**
- Must also be struck that life-instincts have much more to do with our inner perception
- Since they make appearance as disturbers of peace
- Continually bring along states of tension whose resolution experienced as pleasure

**Position 167: Death-Instincts Function Unostentatiously**
- While death-instincts on other hand seem to fulfill function unostentatiously
- Pleasure-principle seems directly to subserve death-instincts
- Keeps guard over external stimuli regarded as dangers by both kinds of instincts
- But in particular over inner increases in stimulation having for aim complication of task of living

**Position 168: Innumerable Questions Without Answers**
- At this point innumerable other questions arise to which no answer can yet be given
- Must be patient and wait for other means and opportunities for investigation
- Must hold ourselves too in readiness to abandon path we followed for time if it should seem to lead to no good result

**Position 169: Only True Believers Expect Science as Creed Substitute**
- Only such "true believers" as expect from science substitute for creed they relinquished
- Will take it amiss if investigator develops views further or even transforms them

**Position 170: Consolation in Slow Scientific Progress**
- For rest we may find consolation in poet's words for slow rate of progress in scientific knowledge:
- "Whither we cannot fly, we must go limping"
- "The Scripture saith that limping is no sin"
