Hume's arguments become tautologically false if stated in terms of ordinary properties, or vacuous if stated in terms of bent predicates.

        "statement": "According to Kuczynski (2012), schizoid and psychotic disorders involve scrambling of the subject's grasp of reality itself because early-life attachments were negative (not merely ambiguous), disposing them to flee from reality in the most radical way possible. By contrast, histrionic, borderline, and dependent disorders involve fundamentally non-delusive grasp of reality but inappropriate emotions because early-life attachments were ambivalent, disposing them to keep distance from external reality without altogether abandoning it.",
        "justification": "OCD, PTSD, and eating disorders all involve fear- or trauma-driven self-isolation. The obsessive-compulsive is the quintessential loner hiding from the world and own emotions behind irrational fantasy-based obsessions. Anxious-ambivalent early attachments dispose people to deal with trauma by withdrawing rather than connecting with others.",
