**WORK-005: SELECTED PAPERS ON HYSTERIA AND OTHER PSYCHONEUROSES (1893-1906) - 43 POSITIONS**

**MENTAL CAUSATION (8 positions): MENT-001 to MENT-008**
- MENT-001: Hysterical symptoms have purely psychical causes from traumatic experiences
- MENT-002: Repressed ideas can exert causal power producing physical symptoms (conversion)
- MENT-003: Mental splitting creates separate streams of consciousness operating independently
- MENT-004: Unconscious ideas maintain causal efficacy when excluded from conscious awareness

- MENT-006: Symptoms are overdetermined - multiple psychical paths converge on each symptom
- MENT-007: Every symptom detail has psychological motivation and significance
- MENT-008: Psychical determinism - all mental phenomena have psychological causes

**MEMORY THEORY (7 positions): MEMR-001 to MEMR-007**
- MEMR-001: Traumatic memories retain affective charge even when not consciously recalled
- MEMR-002: Abreaction (discharge of affect) necessary for memory to lose pathogenic power
- MEMR-003: Memories can be "strangulated" - retained without emotional discharge
- MEMR-004: Hypnosis can recover memories inaccessible to normal recall
- MEMR-005: Memory traces can be distorted but retain essential content in unconscious
- MEMR-006: Pathogenic memories lie ready "close by" in easily approachable associations
- MEMR-007: Forgotten pathogenic ideas always exist and are merely excluded from association

**SEXUAL ETIOLOGY (6 positions): SEXE-001 to SEXE-006**
- SEXE-001: Sexual factors play primary etiological role in neuroses
- SEXE-002: Sexual development begins in childhood, not at puberty
- SEXE-003: Sexual trauma in childhood has specific pathogenic effects
- SEXE-004: Infantile sexual experiences dictate course of later sexual life after maturity
- SEXE-005: Concept of sexuality must be broadened beyond genital intercourse to infantile pleasures
- SEXE-006: Sexual constitution placed in place of general neuropathic predisposition

**DEFENSE MECHANISM (7 positions): DEFE-001 to DEFE-007**
- DEFE-001: Psychic force (ego repugnance) crowds pathogenic ideas from association
- DEFE-002: Defense mechanisms protect ego from ideas incompatible with moral self-conception
- DEFE-003: Ego actively defends against threatening ideas through repression
- DEFE-004: Splitting of consciousness results from intentional act of will (defense)
- DEFE-005: Conversion is bringing about at cost of recollected affects
- DEFE-006: Defense succeeds by weakening strong idea and robbing it of affect
- DEFE-007: Repression serves to free individual from unbearable presentations

**THERAPEUTIC THEORY (8 positions): THER-001 to THER-008**
- THER-001: Cathartic method - bringing repressed material to consciousness with affect produces therapeutic benefit
- THER-002: Talking cure works by allowing symbolic verbal expression of what was expressed somatically
- THER-003: Physician must overcome patient resistance through persistent inquiry
- THER-004: Therapeutic success requires patient to consciously confront repressed trauma
- THER-005: Pressure procedure can reveal pathogenic reminiscences without hypnosis
- THER-006: Therapy abrogates efficacy of non-ab-reacted presentation by affording outlet through speech
- THER-007: Therapy brings material to associative correction by drawing into normal consciousness
- THER-008: Psychoanalytic method enables removal of symptoms by making unconscious conscious

**CONSCIOUSNESS STRUCTURE (7 positions): CONS-001 to CONS-007**
- CONS-001: Consciousness not coextensive with mental life - unconscious contains active mental content
- CONS-002: Hypnoid states create conditions for pathological ideation separate from normal consciousness
- CONS-003: Ideas can be inadmissible to consciousness due to incompatibility with ego
- CONS-004: Boundary between conscious and unconscious maintained by active psychological forces
- CONS-005: Double consciousness or splitting is fundamental characteristic of hysteria
- CONS-006: Splitting of consciousness exists rudimentarily in every hysteria
- CONS-007: Hypnoid states represent higher organization as rudimentary second consciousness
