## WORK-001 BEYOND THE PLEASURE PRINCIPLE (1920) - 170 POSITIONS
### PHILOSOPHY OF MIND & PSYCHOLOGY
1. Mental processes automatically regulated by pleasure-principle (tension reduction)
2. Complete theory requires topographical, dynamic, AND economic elements (metapsychology)
3. Rate of excitation change more important than absolute quantity for feeling
4. Fechner pleasure/pain relate to stability/instability conditions (equilibrium theory)
5. Psychic apparatus keeps excitation low/constant (constancy principle)
6. Pleasure-principle has limited not absolute supremacy (opposed by other forces)
7. Reality-principle replaces pleasure-principle for adaptation (postponement, renunciation)
8. Repression during development creates neurotic pain = pleasure cannot be experienced
9. Most pain is perceptual unsatisfied instincts OR external danger stimuli

### THEORY OF TRAUMA AND NEUROSIS
10. Traumatic neurosis from severe shock with life danger (not just organic injury)
11. Fright/Fear/Apprehension are distinct Fright = unprepared encounter with danger
12. Apprehension protects against trauma (preparation prevents fright-neurosis)
13. Traumatic dreams violate wish-fulfillment (attempt retroactive apprehension development)
14. Child's fort-da game repeats unpleasant separation for mastery
15. Play transforms passivity to activity (child applies unpleasant to playfellow)
16. Patient repeats rather than remembers (transference as compulsion sphere)
17. Transference-neurosis replaces earlier neurosis in treatment
18. Resistance from ego not from repressed (unconscious strives toward consciousness)
19. Repetition-compulsion revives experiences with no pleasure potential
20. Normal life shows repetition-compulsion (pursuing fate, daemonic destiny)
21. Active vs passive repetition (character trait vs seeming passivity)
22. Repetition-compulsion real existence beyond pleasure-principle established

### INSTINCT THEORY AND DEATH DRIVE
23. Consciousness not universal characteristic but special boundary function
24. Consciousness and memory-trace incompatible in same system
25. System Bw characteristics from exposed position (immediate external contact)
26. Living vesicle surface differentiated by position (burned rind for reception)
27. Protection against stimuli more important than reception
28. Unconscious processes timeless (not chronological)
29. Inner excitations bypass protective barrier (no internal protection)
30. Projection origin treating painful inner as if external (defensive externalization)
31. Trauma = excitations breaking through barrier (relationship to efficacious barrier)
32. Binding traumatic stimuli converting free-flowing to quiescent energy
33. Counter-charge mechanism around breach (impoverishing other systems)
34. Binding force proportionate to quiescent charge level
35. Free-flowing vs quiescent energy distinction (Breuer) fundamental to metapsychology
36. Traumatic neurosis as barrier rupture (old shock theory rehabilitated)
37. Fright = failure of apprehension/preparation mechanism
38. Traumatic dreams re-establish preparation retroactively (not wish-fulfillment)
39. First exception to dream wish-fulfillment principle (traumatic/childhood trauma dreams)
40. Dreams may have prehistoric past function before wish-fulfillment
41. Instinct = conservative tendency toward reinstatement of earlier condition
42. Animal behavior evidence migration, spawning journeys to earlier homes
43. Embryonic development repeats ancestral forms (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny)
44. Regeneration demonstrates conservative organic tendency
45. All instincts aim at earlier condition (development from external forces only)
46. Evolution result of external forces (conservative instincts store enforced changes)
47. The goal of all life is death - return to inorganic starting point
48. Life origin properties awakened in lifeless matter (baffling force created tension)
49. First instinct = return to lifelessness (death drive most primitive)
50. Circuitous routes to death = phenomena of life (external forces compelled detours)
51. Self-preservation instincts = part-instincts securing peculiar death path
52. Organism dies only its own way (watchmen of life = myrmidons of death)
53. Sexual instincts exception (not all organisms developed; many stayed primitive)
54. Reproductive cells retain original structure (detach charged with dispositions)
55. Germ cells operate against death (potential immortality through regeneration)
56. Fortification through mingling (sexual union essential for life function)
57. Sexual instincts specially conservative (resistant, preserve life longer = life-instincts)
58. Contradiction between life/death instincts (oscillating rhythm in organisms)
59. Sexuality not at dawn of life but opposition to ego-instincts may have been
60. No general impulse toward higher development (no examples counter to conservative)
61. Higher development often balanced by retrogression (relative valuation)
62. No impulse toward perfection in man (reject superman concept)
63. Striving for perfection = repression effect (culture built on repression)
64. Excess demand over satisfaction creates driving momentum (Mephisto urges ever forward)
65. Path back barred by repression (forward movement = failed regression)
66. Perfection impulse not universal (minority phenomenon, rare economic conditions)
67. Sharp antithesis ego-instincts (death) vs sexual instincts (life)
68. Ego-instincts from vitalizing inanimate matter (aim = lifelessness reinstatement)
69. Sexual union as condition for immortality (germ cell death without it)
70. What does sexual reproduction repeat (Unanswered; would relieve if theory wrong)
71. Testing natural death assumption (made light-heartedly, consolatory belief)
72. Natural death may be illusion (alien to primitive races = enemy/spirit attribution)
73. Little biological agreement on death (conception eludes biologists)
74. Weismann mortal soma vs immortal germ-plasm distinction
75. Weismann's differentiation only for multicellular (unicellular = immortal)
76. Death as purposive contrivance for multicellular (adaptation not necessity)
77. Death became possible/expedient with soma/germ-plasm differentiation
78. Propagation not introduced with death (primordial like growth)
79. Late death doesn't help death instinct theory (would undermine it)
80. Debate over Weismann not decisive (multiple conflicting views)
81. Protozoa subject to death (coincides with propagation but disguised)
82. Woodruff slipper-animalcule to 3029th generation (immortality experiment)
83. Contradictory findings Maupas/Calkins found aging/death in infusoria
84. Conjugation prevents aging (rejuvenation through mingling)
85. Invigorating influence replaceable (chemical/mechanical stimuli work too)
86. Infusoria die from own metabolic products (natural death mechanism)
87. Own products fatal but not related species products (proved convincingly)
88. All higher animals die from metabolic product disposal inability
89. Doubt about studying death in protozoa (primitive organization may conceal)
90. Dynamic vs morphological viewpoint shift (indifferent if protozoa death proved)
91. Death-instincts may be active from beginning (obscured by life forces)
92. Even protozoa immortality doesn't invalidate hypothesis (manifestation vs process)
93. Weismann distinction/death-life instinct distinction resemblance unshaken
94. Hering anabolic vs katabolic processes = our two instinctive tendencies
95. Convergence with Schopenhauer (death = real result; sex = will to live)
96. Multicellularity as life-prolongation means (one cell helps preserve others)
97. Conjugation has preservative/rejuvenating effect (prototype for sexual effect)
98. Libido theory applied to cells (sexual instincts in each cell neutralize death-instincts)
99. Germ cells behave narcissistically (concentrate libido on self for later construction)
100. Malignant growths as narcissistic (pathology sees embryonal attributes)

### LIBIDO THEORY DEVELOPMENT
101. Initial opposition sexual vs ego-instincts (transference-neuroses analysis)
102. Psychoanalysis adhered to hunger and love distinction
103. Extension of sexuality concept (beyond propagation function)
104. Psychoanalysis approached psychological ego (repressing/censoring agency)
105. Objections to narrow libido concept (critics lacked alternative)
106. Libido withdrawn from object to ego (introversion observation)
107. Ego as sexual object (choicest among them)
108. Narcissistic libido = sexual instinct energy (identified with self-preservation)
109. Part of ego-instincts recognized as libidinous
110. Difference now topographical not qualitative (ego vs object investment)
111. Accentuating libidinous character of self-preservation instincts
112. Risk of having only libidinous instincts (critics right about pansexualism)
113. Result not intended (started with sharp ego/sexual distinction)
114. Dualistic standpoint maintained (life vs death instincts now)
115. Jung's monistic confusion (libido = all instinctive energy)
116. Analysis of ego progress insufficient (hard to demonstrate other instincts)
117. Narcissism conjecture already present (ego-instincts drew libidinous components)
118. Analysis only demonstrates libidinous impulses (doesn't prove no others)
119. New polarity love (tenderness) vs hate (aggression)
120. Sadism as death-instinct component (long recognized in sexuality)
121. Sadism derived from death-instinct (driven from ego by narcissistic libido)
122. Sadism's progressive role in sexuality (oral→separation→genital primacy)
123. Hate-love ambivalence setup (where sadism experiences no fusion)
124. Masochism as return to earlier phase (recoil of sadism onto ego)
125. Masochism may be primary (correction of earlier denial)
126. Conjugation effect as prototype (strengthening/rejuvenating in protozoa)
127. Blending introduces new stimulus masses (life renewal mechanism)
128. Union increases chemical tensions (life process otherwise equalizes to death)
129. Nirvana-principle recognition (struggle for stimulus tension removal)
130. Sexual instinct lacks repetition-compulsion character (disturbing for theory)
131. Germ cells as repetitions (sexual propagation repeats organic beginning)
132. Must enquire into sexual propagation origin (lay mind quails, specialists unsolved)
133. Sex as advantageous amphimixis utilization (Darwinian view)
134. Amphimixis from fortuitous conjugation (sex not ancient; repeat what chanced)
135. Same question recurs for sex as for death (crediting protozoa with more)
136. Objection presupposes life-instincts from beginning (conjugation retained/elaborated)
137. Working with two unknown quantities (sex origin obscure as death)
138. Plato's Aristophanes myth (fantastic but fulfills one condition)
139. Plato's three original sexes (third had equal share in male/female)
140. Zeus divided original beings (longing for other half, desired to grow together)
141. Daring assumption of original rent (living substance split, strives for reunion)
142. Sexual instincts continue chemical affinity (from inanimate matter)
143. Dispersed fragments achieve multicellular organization (transfer reunion instinct to germ cells)

### EPISTEMOLOGY & METHODOLOGY
144. Uncertainty about personal conviction (neither convinced nor seeking conviction)
145. Following thought as scientific curiosity (advocatus diaboli permissible)
146. Third step less certain than first two (sexuality extension/narcissism more solid)
147. Regressive instinct character based on observation (repetition-compulsion facts)
148. Departing far from observation (combining facts with imagination repeatedly)
149. Distrust of intuition (impartiality of intellect rare on ultimate questions)
150. Deep-rooted preferences control speculation (unwittingly playing into their hands)
151. Self-criticism doesn't require tolerance (reject contradicted theories; know own tentative)
152. No disturbance from surprising processes (instinct expelled, turning, etc. expected from metaphor)
153. Obliged to use metaphorical language (psychology of deeper layers requires it)
154. Psychological terms are metaphors (like physiological/chemical would be)
155. Biology may overthrow hypothesis structure (limitless possibilities expected)
156. Perhaps overthrow whole structure (someone may ask why communicate it then)

### FUNCTION AND TENDENCY
157. Distinguish function from tendency (pleasure-principle = tendency serving function)
158. Cannot yet decide between conceptions (eliminate excitation vs keep constant/low)
159. Greatest pleasure in temporary quenching (sexual climax as paradigm)
160. Bound vs unbound processes and sensation (unbound = more intense both directions)
161. Primary processes earlier in time (beginning of mental life)
162. Search for pleasure more intense at beginning (but less unrestrictedly)
163. Dominance more assured at maturity (though still limited)
164. Further studies required on tension (tension may be pleasurable or painful itself)
165. Questions about bound/unbound and tension (sensation correlates unclear)
166. Life-instincts appear as disturbers (make appearance, bring tension states)
167. Death-instincts function unostentatiously (pleasure-principle serves death)
168. Innumerable questions without answers (must be patient, ready to abandon path)
169. Only true believers expect science as creed substitute (others take amiss theory development)
170. Consolation in slow scientific progress (limping is no sin)

419. Reversal effected under influence of common tender tie with person outside group
420. Demand for equality applies only to members not to leader

### BEING IN LOVE THEORY
421. Being in love involves both directly sexual and aim-inhibited instincts
422. Depth of love measured by share taken by inhibited instincts of tenderness
423. Sexual over-estimation loved object enjoys freedom from criticism
424. All characteristics valued more highly when loved
425. Illusion produced that object loved for spiritual merits not sensual charm
426. Tendency falsifying judgment is idealization
427. Object treated same way as own ego in love
428. Considerable narcissistic libido overflows onto object in love
429. Object serves as substitute for unattained ego ideal
430. Love it for perfections we strove for in own ego
431. Object can get possession of entire self-love of ego
432. Object has consumed ego in extreme cases
433. Traits of humility, limitation of narcissism, self-injury occur in love
434. Functions of ego ideal cease to operate in being in love

### OBJECT REPLACING EGO IDEAL
435. Object takes place of ego ideal as formula for extreme love
436. In identification ego enriched with object properties (introjection)
437. In love ego impoverished, surrendered to object
438. In identification object lost or given up, then set up inside ego
439. In love object retained with hypercathexis by ego at ego's expense
440. Critical distinction whether object put in place of ego or ego ideal

### HYPNOSIS THEORY
441. From being in love to hypnosis only short step
442. Hypnosis shows same humble subjection, compliance, absence of criticism as love
443. Same absorption of own initiative in hypnosis as love
444. Hypnotist stepped into place of ego ideal
445. Everything clearer and more intense in hypnosis than love
446. Hypnotist is sole object with no attention to others
447. Ego experiences requests in dream-like way
448. Ego ideal in hypnosis stops testing reality of things
449. Complete absence of uninhibited sexual tendencies contributes to purity
450. Hypnotic relation is devotion in love with sexual satisfaction excluded
451. Hypnosis is group formation with two members

### LASTING TIES THEORY
452. Sexual tendencies inhibited in aims achieve lasting ties between men
453. Not capable of complete satisfaction unlike uninhibited tendencies
454. Uninhibited sexual tendencies suffer extraordinary reduction through discharge
455. Sensual love becomes extinguished when satisfied unless mixed with tender components

### HERD INSTINCT CRITIQUE
456. Herd instinct postulated by Trotter as primitive and irreducible
457. Herd feeling appears already in nursery as reaction-formation against jealousy
458. Trotter derives social instinct from gregariousness in animals
459. Man not herd animal but horde animal led by chief
460. Many equals identify with one another, single person superior to all

### PRIMAL HORDE THEORY
461. Darwin's conjecture primitive human society was horde ruled despotically by powerful male
462. Development of totemism connected with killing of chief and transformation to brother community
463. Human groups exhibit picture of superior individual among similar companions
464. Psychology of group corresponds to regression to primitive mental activity of primal horde
465. Group is revival of primal horde
466. Primal horde may arise from any random crowd
467. Group psychology is oldest human psychology
468. Individual psychology emerged gradually from old group psychology
469. Two kinds of psychology from first member psychology and father/chief/leader psychology
470. Members subject to ties, father of primal horde was free
471. Primal father's ego had few libidinal ties
472. Primal father loved no one but himself or others only as they served his needs

### EGO IDEAL THEORY
473. Ego ideal is heir to narcissism
474. Ego ideal formed by influence of parents and upbringing
475. Child's own self-love displaced onto ideal ego
476. Ego ideal has social side as common ideal of family/class/nation
477. Ego ideal binds libidinal satisfaction from parents and social demands
478. Conscience is mental faculty watching over ego ideal compliance
479. Self-regard depends on fulfilling ego ideal demands
480. Sense of guilt arises when ego fails to satisfy ego ideal
481. Ego ideal comprises sum of all limitations ego must accept
482. Abrogation of ideal would be magnificent festival for ego
483. Feeling of triumph when something in ego coincides with ego ideal
484. Sense of guilt and inferiority express tension between ego and ego ideal
485. Ego ideal can be temporarily resolved into ego
486. Separation of ego ideal from ego cannot be borne for long

### MELANCHOLIA AND MANIA THEORY
487. Cyclical mood oscillations between depression and exalted well-being
488. In mania ego and ego ideal fuse together
489. Manic enjoys abolition of inhibitions, feelings of consideration, self-reproaches
490. Melancholia expresses sharp conflict between ego faculties
491. In melancholia ego ideal relentlessly condemns ego in delusions of inferiority
492. Melancholia can occur after loss of loved object
493. Lost object set up inside ego by identification and condemned by ego ideal
494. Reproaches to object come to light as melancholic self-reproaches

### INSTINCTS INHIBITED IN AIMS
495. Directly sexual tendencies always accompanied by tender emotional ties
496. Tender feeling is successor to completely sensual object tie
497. Sexual ties of childhood persist though repressed and unconscious
498. Instincts inhibited in aims preserve some original sexual aims
499. Inhibited instincts have great functional advantage over uninhibited
500. Inhibited instincts especially adapted to create permanent ties
501. Inhibited instincts capable of any degree of admixture with uninhibited
502. Emotional ties can easily develop into erotic wishes
503. Religious ties can revert to sexual excitement
504. Sexual tendencies can transform into lasting purely tender ties

### SEXUAL LOVE VS GROUP TIES
505. Directly sexual tendencies unfavorable to group formation
506. Sexual love developed characteristics requiring limitation to two people
507. Two in sexual satisfaction make demonstration against herd instinct
508. More in love, more completely suffice for each other
509. Violent jealousy protects sexual object-choice from group tie encroachment
510. Being in love late appearance in sexual relations between men and women

## WORK-006 GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOANALYSIS (1916-17) - 238 POSITIONS

### INTRODUCTION: PSYCHOANALYSIS AS METHOD (20)
511. Psychoanalysis is method of treating nervous patients medically
512. Psychoanalytic procedure reverses usual medical introduction (warns of difficulties)
513. Teaching psychoanalysis involves showing imperfections and difficulties
514. Previous training and mental habits make people opponents of psychoanalysis
515. Psychoanalytic understanding cannot be gained from mere lectures
516. Psychoanalysis requires overcoming instinctive opposition
517. Choosing psychoanalysis as profession ruins university success
518. Society regards psychoanalysis with suspicion and hostility
519. Psychoanalysis demonstrated through interchange of words only
520. Words retain magical power (not mere talk)
521. Psychoanalytic conversation brooks no auditor (requires privacy)
522. Patient's communications concern most intimate psychic life
523. Communications deal with what person won't admit to himself
524. Cannot observe psychoanalytic treatment directly (only by hearsay)
525. Understanding psychoanalysis depends on faith in instructor
526. Psychoanalysis learned through study of one's own personality
527. Best method is being analyzed by competent analyst
528. Self-analysis has definite limits compared to being analyzed
529. Medical training directs attention away from psychic life
530. Lack of philosophical science of therapy for medical purposes

### EPISTEMOLOGY & RESISTANCE (15)
531. No speculative philosophy or descriptive psychology provides practical therapeutic knowledge
532. Experimental psychology allied with sense physiology insufficient
533. Psychiatry describes symptoms but lacks causal explanation
534. Psychiatry doubts its own descriptions deserve name of science
535. Psychoanalysis aims to fill gap in psychiatric foundation
536. Psychoanalysis must divorce itself from anatomical/chemical/physiological suppositions
537. Psychoanalysis works with purely psychological concepts
538. First assertion: psychic processes are in themselves unconscious
539. Conscious processes are merely isolated acts of total psychic life
540. Common view identifies psychic with conscious (psychoanalysis rejects this)
541. Psychoanalysis defines psychic as feeling/thinking/willing processes
542. Unconscious thinking and unconscious willing exist
543. Acceptance of unconscious processes leads to new orientation in science
544. Second assertion: sexual impulses play large role in nervous/mental disease causation
545. Sexual impulses contribute to highest cultural/artistic/social achievements

### CULTURE AND SEXUALITY (12)
546. Civilization forged by vital necessity at cost of instinct-satisfaction
547. Each individual repeats sacrifice of instinct-satisfaction for common good
548. Sexual impulses play significant role among utilized instinctive forces
549. Sexual instincts sublimated (diverted to higher non-sexual ends)
550. Sublimation result is unstable (sexual instincts poorly tamed)
551. Society threatened by satisfying sexual instincts at original goals
552. Society has no interest in recognizing strength of sexual instincts
553. Society diverts attention from sexual life
554. Unpleasant ideas deemed untrue by human nature
555. Society brands psychoanalytic findings as untrue from affective sources
556. Prejudices against psychoanalysis held despite attempts at refutation
557. Psychoanalysis claims right to reject practical considerations in research

### PSYCHOLOGY OF ERRORS: FOUNDATIONS (25)
558. Errors are very frequent, familiar, little heeded phenomena
559. Errors observable in every normal person
560. Errors include slips of tongue/pen/reading, mishearing, forgetting
561. Temporary forgetting distinct from permanent forgetting
562. Mislaying and losing things as forms of forgetting
563. Erroneous ideas have transient character
564. Errors are unimportant, temporary, without much life significance
565. Small signs can betray very important things
566. Faint signs reveal what conspicuous manifestations conceal
567. Modest research with discoverable method more fruitful than grand resolutions
568. Connection links small to great in scientific research
569. Popular view: errors are slight accident not worth explanation
570. Denying natural determination at one point vitiates entire scientific viewpoint
571. Religious viewpoint more consistent (no sparrow falls without God's wish)
572. Errors occur with special frequency when tired/ill/excited
573. Forgetting names frequent when indisposed
574. Distraction concentrating attention elsewhere causes errors
575. Illness and circulatory disorders provide physiological basis for errors
576. Fatigue/distraction/excitement are psycho-physiological conditions
577. Attention theory: errors from scattering of attention
578. Not everything squares with attention theory
579. Automatic acts can be carried out successfully with little attention
580. Virtuoso practice makes errors less likely not more
581. Excitement should intensify attention on desired goal
582. Attention theory doesn't explain all error phenomena

### MEANING AND STRUCTURE OF ERRORS (28)
583. Errors can be regarded from perspective of what they result in
584. Meringer and Mayer differentiated distortions descriptively
585. Categories: interchanges of words/syllables, perseverations, compoundings, substitutions
586. Most frequent slips: saying word resembling intended word
587. Opposites have close relationship in psychology of association
588. Common slips say exact opposite of what was meant
589. Facile associations can arise inopportunely
590. Previous phrase influences slip even without being spoken
591. Product of slip can itself make sense as valid psychic act
592. Slip has right to be considered valid manifestation with content/meaning
593. In some errors the slip expresses obvious meaning
594. Slips used by poets indicate they consider errors meaningful
595. Poets create slips on purpose for dramatic effect
596. Portia's slip in Merchant of Venice reveals concealed love
597. Shakespeare understood meaning of errors
598. Lichtenberg's observation anticipated theory of misreadings
599. All dreams fulfill wishes but not all errors meaningful
600. Error meaning is purpose/intention/position in psychic sequence
601. Errors arise through mutual interference of two intentions
602. Most frequent errors: one intention contains opposite of other
603. Slips can express antithetical meaning through distortion
604. Slips add second meaning to intended one
605. Abbreviation and condensation in certain slips
606. Some slips unintelligible but result from interference of two speeches
607. Distortion of names can be insult in disguised form
608. Errors can have comical or absurd effect indicating disrespect
609. Name distortions occur as intentional insult device
610. Harmless words made obscene can be slip or intentional wit

### INTERFERENCE MECHANISMS (22)
611. Errors solved through collaboration/interference of two different intentions
612. Explanation valid for most if not all tongue slips
613. Same conception extends to other types of errors
614. Bodily factors (fatigue/illness) only facilitate errors not cause them
615. Bodily predispositions not necessary conditions for errors
616. Loneliness and darkness analogy: facilitation vs causation distinction
617. Sound relationships and word resemblances facilitate but don't explain slips
618. Association tendencies serve only to facilitate not cause slips
619. Wundt's theory (association gains upper hand when fatigued) incomplete
620. Two mutually antagonistic tendencies produce errors
621. Intention interfered with always unmistakable (person acknowledges it)
622. Interfering tendency causes doubt and hesitation
623. In some cases both tendencies equally plain from slip effect
624. Most direct method: ask speaker what he meant to say
625. Speaker immediately supplies originally intended expression
626. Same method discovers interfering meaning
627. This investigation is prototype of psychoanalysis
628. Subject's first association is not arbitrary but determined
629. Psychic fact must be respected (not dismissed as arbitrary)
630. Illusion of psychic freedom must be given up
631. Solution discovered by analyzed subject himself in psychoanalysis
632. Subject may deny interfering intention energetically

### VERIFICATION AND INTERPRETATION (18)
633. When subject acknowledges slip meaning, no doubt remains
634. When subject denies information, direct proof unavailable
635. Judge/defendant analogy: confession vs denial
636. Subject's denial doesn't eliminate interfering intention
637. Resistance reveals personal interest in slip being meaningless
638. Science consists chiefly of assertions at various probability levels
639. Scientific thinking content with approximations of certainty
640. Interpretations derived from multiple sources not just subject's statement
641. Analogies with non-error phenomena provide evidence
642. Psychic situation provides interpretive context
643. Character of person who made error is relevant
644. Impressions received before error are relevant
645. General principles help find meaning first as conjecture
646. Subsequent developments can verify conjectures
647. Accumulated errors show stubbornness incompatible with accident
648. Combined errors reveal essential element of error is purpose
649. Interchange of error types shows purpose more important than form
650. Case of repeated forgetting (Jones' letter) shows persistent opposition

### FORGETTING AND MISLAYING (20)
651. Forgetting names often indicates something against name-bearer
652. Mr. Y forgot rival's name repeatedly showing aversion
653. Lady forgot friend's married name due to dislike of husband
654. Forgetting projects commonly traced to antagonistic current
655. Patron's apology for forgetting indicates unwillingness
656. Popular conception recognizes forgetting as meaningful in practice
657. Forgetting appointments/promises suggests opposition
658. Military excuse of forgetting is useless and rightly so
659. Everyone agrees certain errors are significant (forgetting)
660. Shaw's Caesar forgets to say goodbye showing superiority claim
661. Loss of object may serve purpose of getting rid of it
662. Young man lost pencil from disliked brother-in-law
663. Persons lose objects after falling out with donors
664. Objects lost when no longer liked (pretext for replacement)
665. Letting things fall/break shows same anti-object intention
666. School child loses belongings before birthday for new ones
667. Mislaying can reflect temporary desire to eliminate object
668. Young man mislaid wife's gift book during marital coolness
669. Book found when wife showed her best qualities
670. With cessation of motive, inability to find object ended

### THREE GROUPS OF INTERFERING INTENTIONS (13)
671. Interfering tendencies divide into three groups
672. First group: interfering tendency known and felt before slip
673. Second group: interfering tendency recognized as own but not felt active before
674. Third group: interfering intention energetically denied by speaker
675. Subject denies interfering intention was ever active
676. Subject claims interfering intention alien to him
677. All three groups share common mechanism
678. Suppressed intention obtains expression against speaker's will
679. Suppression of intention indispensable condition for error occurrence
680. In first group intention present before utterance then suppressed
681. In second group suppression extends farther back
682. Third group involves long-term suppression
683. Suppression of existing intention to say something causes slip

### COMPROMISE FORMATIONS AND SYMPTOMATIC ACTS (16)
684. Errors are compromise formations (partial success/failure for both intentions)
685. Endangered intention neither completely suppressed nor wholly intact
686. Special conditions must exist for compromise formation
687. Errors widen province of psychic phenomena considerably
688. Errors are meaningful psychic acts not mere accidents
689. Error phenomena result from psychic not organic influences
690. Meaning = significance/purpose/tendency/position in psychic relations
691. Accidental and symptomatic acts related to errors
692. Symptomatic acts appear unmotivated, insignificant, superfluous
693. Symptomatic acts lack another intention with which they collide
694. Symptomatic acts include playful performances with clothing/body/objects
695. Humming melodies are symptomatic acts
696. All symptomatic acts are meaningful and interpretable like errors
697. Symptomatic acts are small manifestations of important psychic processes
698. Symptomatic acts are valid psychic acts
699. Errors allow psychoanalytic inquiries to be worked out clearly

### RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN INTENTIONS (18)
700. Two questions: what kinds of intentions interfere, what proportions relate them
701. Interfering intention may contradict/correct/supplement interfered intention
702. Or interfering intention has nothing to do with interfered intention
703. First relation found in cases where opposite is said
704. Political editor writes "interested" instead of "disinterested"
705. Representative says "rueckgratlos" (spineless) instead of "rueckhaltlos" (unreserved)
706. Second type: correction/addition/continuation by second tendency
707. "Things were refiled" = "revealed" + "filthy"
708. "One finger" = "fingers of one hand" but really only one person
709. "Whatever I want" = husband's wants controlled by wife
710. Slip arises from content or connected to intention interfered with
711. Other type: interfering intention unrelated to content interfered with
712. Interference originates in just-previous thought process
713. Perseveration but not necessarily of spoken words
714. Associative connection artificially restored with forced links
715. Example: lady says "nach Hose" instead of "nach Hause" (suppressed "drawers")
716. Suppressed content breaks through in next sentence
717. Common quality links interfering to interfered intention

### SUPPRESSION AND RESISTANCE (31)
718. Interfering intentions fall into three groups by suppression degree
719. Group 1: tendency known to speaker and felt before slip
720. Group 2: tendency recognized afterward but not felt before
721. Group 3: tendency energetically denied as ever present
722. Example "refiled": speaker admits judgment "filthy" and intended expression
723. Group 2: interfering tendency immediately recognized but surprised by it
724. Group 3: interpretation energetically denied by speaker
725. Toastmaster ("hiccough") absolutely denied interfering intention
726. Intentions unknown to speaker can manifest themselves
727. Carrying through error conception requires accepting unknown intentions
728. Suppressed intention in first two groups recognized by speaker
729. In Group 1 intention showed itself before slip then suppressed
730. Intention prevented from speech conversion then emerged as slip
731. Suppressed tendency obtains expression against will
732. Changes permitted expression or mixes with it or replaces it
733. This is the mechanism of tongue slip
734. Must assume three groups differentiated by suppression effectiveness
735. Group 1: intention present and perceptible before utterance
736. Group 2: suppression prevents perception before speaking
737. Group 3: suppression extends over long time, perhaps very long
738. Suppressed intention doesn't become perceptible in Group 3
739. Cannot be directly denied because not conscious in Group 3
740. Suppression of intention to say something is indispensable for slip
741. Why doesn't suppression succeed completely or fail completely
742. Errors are compromise formations between intentions
743. Special unknown conditions must exist for compromise formation
744. Must examine other obscure psychic fields for analogies
745. Working with small signs brings dangers (paranoia uses excessively)
746. Broad basis of observations protects from error
747. Dynamic conception of psychic phenomena (not mere description)
748. Perceived phenomena give way to assumed strivings/tendencies

## WORK-007 GENERAL INTRODUCTION LECTURES 5-15 ON DREAMS (1916-17) - 341 POSITIONS

### LECTURE 5: DIFFICULTIES AND PRELIMINARY APPROACH

#### DREAM AS SCIENTIFIC OBJECT (15)
749. Dream discovery that disease symptoms have meaning led to psychoanalytic method
750. Dream study is best preparation for study of neuroses
751. Dream itself is neurotic symptom occurring in all normals
752. If all humans were well and dreamed, dreams alone would give insight equal to neurosis study
753. Errors were neglected by science but dream carries odium of unscientific
754. Dream regarded as ignominious, awakens suspicion of mysticism
755. Objection that dream too trifling compared to tumors/hemorrhages/inflammations
756. Dream defies exact research requirements (object not even sure)
757. Dream cannot be related accurately, changes in telling
758. Most dreams cannot be remembered, forgotten except fragments
759. Objections to dream as research object go too far
760. Question of insignificance already dealt with in discussing errors
761. Small signs may manifest important matters
762. Indefiniteness is characteristic like any other, cannot prescribe characteristics
763. Indefinite dreams exist alongside clear/definite ones
764. Other psychiatric objects suffer same indefiniteness (compulsion ideas)
765. Task: take what dreamer tells as dream without regard to forgotten/changed parts
766. Dream's mood may continue throughout whole day
767. Psychosis can begin with dream and hold to delusion originated in it
768. Historical personages drew inspiration for important deeds from dreams
769. Contempt for dream is reaction to overestimation in former times
770. Ancients of 3000+ years ago dreamed much as we do
771. Ancient peoples attached great importance to dreams, considered practically valuable
772. Dreams used to draw omens for future, seek premonitions
773. Greeks and Orientals used dream interpreters in campaigns (like aviation scouts today)

#### ANCIENT DREAM INTERPRETATION (10)
774. Alexander the Great's campaign had famous dream interpreters in attendance
775. City of Tyrus story: Alexander dreamed satyr dancing = victory announced
776. Among Etruscans/Romans other future-discovery methods used but dream interpretation practiced
777. Artemidoros of Daldis book (Emperor Hadrian's time) chief preserved literature work
778. Art of dream interpretation gradually lost, interest deteriorated into superstition
779. Exact science dealt with dreams only to apply physiological theories
780. Physicians considered dream non-psychic act, manifestation of somatic irritations
781. Binz (1876): dream is bodily process, useless/pathological, world-soul above it
782. Maury compared dream to irregular twitchings of St. Vitus' Dance
783. Old comparison: dream like ten fingers of musically illiterate person on piano keys

#### SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO DREAMS (8)
784. Interpretation means finding hidden meaning
785. Scientific description emphasizes deviations from waking thought disparaging dream
786. Disintegration of association, suspension of critical faculty, elimination of knowledge
787. Only valuable scientific contribution: influence of bodily stimuli during sleep
788. J. Mourly Vold two volumes experimental researches on dreams (Norwegian, 1910/1912)
789. Vold's work deals almost solely with consequences of limb position changes
790. Exact science would reject finding meaning in dreams
791. Psychoanalysis follows ancient dream interpreters despite scientific opposition

### LECTURE 6: HYPOTHESIS AND TECHNIQUE

#### FUNDAMENTAL HYPOTHESIS (12)
792. New path/method needed for dream investigation
793. Assume as hypothesis: dream is not somatic but psychic phenomenon
794. Dream as psychic phenomenon is achievement/expression of dreamer
795. Dream tells us nothing (unintelligible) that we don't understand
796. Ask dreamer to give meaning of his dream (same as error investigation)
797. Someone said "vorschwein" - asked what meant, immediately answered
798. Dreamer himself to discover solutions of riddles (psychoanalytic method)
799. Dreamer always says he knows nothing about dream
800. Dreamer does know what dream means but doesn't know that he knows
801. Believes he doesn't know (same situation as Bernheim hypnosis experiment)
802. Two assumptions: dream is psychic; dreamer has unconscious knowledge of it
803. Assumptions necessary despite appearing improbable

#### BERNHEIM HYPNOSIS EVIDENCE (8)
804. Bernheim (Nancy, 1889) placed subjects in somnambulistic state with hallucinations
805. Upon waking subject knew nothing of hypnotic experiences
806. Bernheim insisted subject did know, must recall
807. Subject wavered, began to remember, recollection became complete
808. Subject finally knew but had no experiences from other source meanwhile
809. Therefore subject knew memories in beginning though inaccessible
810. Subject didn't know that he knew, believed he didn't know
811. This proves we may assume dreamer has inaccessible knowledge of dream

#### FREE ASSOCIATION TECHNIQUE (15)
812. For errors we asked: how did person happen to use wrong word
813. Next idea gave explanation (his next statement taken as explanation)
814. Dream technique: ask how dreamer happened to have dream
815. Next statement to be taken as explanation (disregard dreamer's belief/disbelief)
816. Distinction whether dreamer believes he knows irrelevant (treat both same)
817. Objection: dreamer's next idea could be anything at all (appears arbitrary)
818. We assume dreamer's association will be determined, not arbitrary
819. Belief in psychic freedom is unscientific, must capitulate to determinism
820. Only one association will occur to person questioned (can be proved)
821. Dream technique: separate dream into elements, investigate each separately
822. Sets up analogy to word-slip investigation
823. Some elements produce no associations from dreamer (happens but not always)
824. When no association: contradict dreamer, insist he must have some association
825. Any association acceptable: historical information, reminiscences, anything
826. Three levels of association difficulty: easy immediate, requires insistence, seems impossible

#### ASSOCIATION EXPERIMENTS (10)
827. Free association controlled by given premise (dream element as starting point)
828. Special delimitation of attention required (different from cogitation)
829. Higher level: free association without original premise (name or number freely given)
830. Such "free" associations appear voluntary but are strongly determined
831. Determined by important inner mental set unknown at moment
832. Like disturbing tendencies in errors, provocative tendencies in accidents
833. Investigations by Freud and others: free name associations analyzed
834. Name associations followed by continuous associations revealing motivation
835. Investigations always yield same results, information often covers wealth of material
836. Example: young man asked for woman's name, after silence said "Albino"
837. No other women's names occurred though he had numerous relations with women
838. Man himself had unusually light coloring, was called albino in fun
839. At moment engaged in determining feminine characteristics of nature
840. He himself was the Albino, most interesting feminine person to him at moment
841. Melodies that come for no reason also show conditioning by thought-trains

#### WUNDT SCHOOL EXPERIMENTS (6)
842. Association-experiment: react quickly with any reaction to stimulus-word
843. Study interval between stimulus and reaction, nature of answer, mistakes in repetition
844. Zurich School (Bleuler/Jung) asked for explanation of extraordinary reactions
845. Extraordinary reactions most sharply determined by subject's complexes
846. Association experiment built first bridge from experimental psychology to psychoanalysis
847. Free associations are predetermined, not voluntary as believed

### LECTURE 7: MANIFEST AND LATENT CONTENT

#### NOMENCLATURE AND BASIC DISTINCTIONS (12)
848. Conception of dream element: something unreal, substitute for unknown
849. Like error tendency: substitute for something dreamer knows but cannot approach
850. Method: call up substitute formations through free associations
851. Call what dream relates manifest content of dream
852. Hidden discovered by associations: latent dream thoughts
853. Dream element not real but substitute needing interpretation
854. Let "unconscious" mean inaccessible/unknown to dreamer's consciousness
855. Unconscious "for the time being" initially (temporarily during dream-work)
856. Manifest vs latent dream distinction fundamental
857. Three rules for interpretation: (1) Ignore whether dream sensible/absurd/clear/confused
858. (2) Awakening substitute formations for each element is sole object
859. (3) Wait until hidden unconscious appears of itself (like Monaco word example)

#### INTERPRETATION EXAMPLES (18)
860. How much/little dream remembered unimportant (distortion on top of distortion)
861. Can interpret own dreams as well as others' (learns even more, more proof)
862. Something impedes work when interpreting own dreams (haphazard ideas arise)
863. Tendency to test and choose makes itself felt (objections suppress ideas)
864. Before idea fully clear, objections stifle it by selection
865. "No that doesn't fit, doesn't belong here" (one tendency)
866. "That is too senseless" (second objection type)
867. "This is entirely beside the point" (third objection type)
868. Four objections to ideas: too unimportant, too absurd, too irrelevant, too embarrassing
869. Must make hard rule: never omit any idea even if objections arise
870. Dreamer promises to obey but often keeps promise poorly
871. Critical objections arise in own case despite theoretical conviction
872. Critical objection never justified (ideas suppressed prove most important/decisive)
873. Mark of distinction: idea accompanied by objection
874. Resistance is something entirely new, not originally in hypotheses
875. Resistance proves something of weight hidden behind substitute
876. Resistance is quantitatively variable (greater or lesser resistances)
877. Different resistance levels connect with chain length to unconscious

#### SAMPLE DREAM INTERPRETATIONS (30)
878. Example 1: Lady as child dreamt God had pointed paper hat on head
879. As child made to wear such hat at table to prevent stealing glances at siblings' plates
880. Hat was blinder meant to prevent seeing who got more
881. Dream means: I know/see everything just as God does despite attempts to prevent
882. Example 2: Sceptical patient hears about Freud's book on laughter, something about "canal"
883. "Canal" very vague but vagueness not from difficulty but from dream-censor
884. Patient later remembered joke: "Du sublime au ridicule il n'y a qu'un pas"
885. Author answers "Oui, le pas de Calais" (Calais = canal, English Channel)
886. Joke shows skepticism (France sublime, England ridiculous)
887. Canal element like small part of unconscious, allusion to it
888. Example 3: Peculiar shape table, several family members sitting
889. Table reminded dreamer of family with peculiar father-son relation
890. Same relation exists between dreamer and his father (table = parallel)
891. Family name was "Tischler" (table-maker), so table expresses "we are Tischlers too"
892. Example 4: "Pulls certain woman from behind bed" = woman "has pull" with him
893. Example 5: "Brother is in closet" = clothes-press, brother is "close-pressed" for money
894. Example 6: "Climbs mountain, extraordinarily distant view"
895. Acquaintance publishes "Rundschau" dealing with distant parts of earth
896. Dream = identification of dreamer with "Rundschauer"
897. New type of connection: representation/plastic concrete perversion based on sound
898. Representation of abstract thoughts by concrete images (picture-writing method)
899. Dream has no means to represent "because, therefore, but" - resolves into raw material
900. Number of fragmentary dreams corresponds to number of main themes in latent thought
901. Short preliminary dream often introduction/motivation to complementary dream following
902. Form of dream itself not without significance, challenges interpretation
903. Different dreams same night often have same meaning (increasing effort to control stimulus)
904. Particularly troublesome element may be represented by duplicates (numerous symbols)

#### YOUNG WOMAN'S DREAM (THEATRE TICKETS) (15)
905. Woman married many years dreams: sitting in theatre with husband, one side empty
906. Husband told her Elise L. and fiancé wanted tickets, got only poor seats (3 for 1.50 Fl)
907. She thinks: no misfortune for them (this not taking tickets)
908. Dream occasioned by husband's real report about Elise's engagement
909. Woman really bought theatre tickets in advance, paid preference tax unnecessarily
910. One side of orchestra almost empty (anxiety about hastening needless)
911. Sister-in-law received 150 florins, hastened to jeweler to spend on jewelry
912. Number 3: bride only three months younger than dreamer (married 10 years)
913. Time elements emphasized: too soon, too hastily, precipitately
914. Latent thought: "How foolish to hurry marrying! Elise shows I could have gotten husband later"
915. Precipitateness represented by ticket-buying behavior and sister-in-law's jewelry purchase
916. Theatre-going substituted for getting married
917. "Could have gotten 100 times as much for money" (150 Fl = 100 times 1.50)
918. Main emphasis in latent thought on haste element, absent from manifest dream
919. Senseless combination "3 for 1.50" in manifest dream represents "It was senseless to marry so early"

### LECTURE 8: CHILDREN'S DREAMS

#### CHARACTERISTICS OF CHILDREN'S DREAMS (12)
920. Dreams entirely free of distortion only after applying interpretation method
921. Dreams free of distortion found in children (short, clear, coherent, easy to understand)
922. All children's dreams not like this (distortion appears early in childhood)
923. From conscious psychic activity to fourth/fifth year: series of infantile character dreams
924. Later childhood: some dreams of infantile character occasionally
925. Adults have dreams resembling typically infantile ones under certain conditions
926. From children's dreams: gain information with great ease and certainty
927. No analysis/technique needed for children's dreams
928. Experience of previous day always explains child's dream to us
929. Dream is sleep-reaction to day's experiences
930. Example A: Boy 22 months to give basket of cherries as gift, unwillingly
931. Next morning dreams "Hermann eat all cherries"
932. Example B: Girl 3.25 years first lake trip, doesn't want to leave boat
933. Next morning says "Last night I rode on the lake" (trip lasted longer in dream)
934. Example C: Boy 5.25 years excursion to Escherntal, interested in Dachstein
935. Repeatedly asked "Is that the Dachstein?", became moody/silent
936. Next morning happily reports "Last night I dreamed we were in Simonyhuette"
937. He had expected this, was his expectation for taking excursion

#### THEORETICAL CONCLUSIONS FROM CHILDREN'S DREAMS (18)
938. Children's dreams are intelligible, significant, psychic acts
939. Sharp contrast to medical opinion (untrained fingers on piano keys)
940. If child brings forth complete psychic products in sleep, adult's spasmodic reactions strange
941. Every reason to attribute more normal and deeper sleep to child
942. Dream distortion not inherent in dream (missing in children's dreams)
943. Tiny bit of distortion even in children's dreams (differentiation between manifest/latent)
944. Child's dream is reaction to day's experience leaving regret/longing/unfulfilled desire
945. Dream brings direct unconcealed fulfillment of wish
946. Physical stimuli as dream producers explains only small number of dreams
947. Psychic sleep-disturbing stimuli beside physical (forgotten at outset)
948. Unfulfilled wish is psychic sleep-disturbing stimulus for child
949. Dream as release of psychic stimulus, elimination, continuation of sleep
950. Dream not disturber of sleep but guardian of sleep, duty to quell disturbances
951. Dream couldn't help disturbing slightly (like night watchman making noise)
952. Wish is source of dream, gratification of wish is content
953. Dream represents fulfillment of wish in hallucinatory experience form
954. "I should like to travel on lake" becomes in dream "I travel on lake"
955. Translation of thought into experience is change between latent and manifest

#### UNIVERSAL DREAM CHARACTERISTICS (10)
956. Wish-fulfillment is main characteristic but not sole (second will be qualified)
957. Only extensive investigation can show wish as cause always (not anxiety/plan/reproach)
958. Second characteristic: dream doesn't simply reproduce stimulus but removes/expels it
959. Dream as compromise between sleep-wish and psychic stimulus (like errors)
960. Both sleep-wish and disturbing wish partly carried out, partly given up
961. Day dreams are actual wish fulfillments, conscious, vividly imagined but not hallucinatory
962. Day dreams have one characteristic less firmly established (hallucinatory experience)
963. Day dreams share wish-fulfillment with dreams but not always hallucinatory form
964. Colloquial usage shows presentment: wish-fulfillment main characteristic of dream
965. Proverbs: "Pig dreams of acorns, goose of maize, hen of millet" (descends to animals)

#### INFANTILE VS ADULT DREAMS (8)
966. Writers on dreams often noted wish-fulfillment but none acknowledged as universal
967. If only infantile dreams existed, problem would be solved without difficulty
968. Not all dreams are infantile type (distorted dreams remain unexplained)
969. Dreams from imperative body needs (hunger, thirst, sexual desire) recognized as wish-fulfillments
970. Girl's dream of strawberry/huckleberry menu after day of fasting (Anna F.)
971. Grandmother age 70 dreamed invited out, finest tid-bits (after fasting for kidney trouble)
972. Nordenskjold Antarctic expedition: dreams of food never more vivid than during ice-bound winter
973. Dreams regularly dealt with outside world now far away, often fitted present condition

#### ADDITIONAL DREAM EXAMPLES (15)
974. Nordenskjold: food and drink were pivots around which dreams revolved
975. One crew member attended three-course dinners in sleep
976. Another dreamed of tobacco, whole mountains of tobacco
977. Another dreamed of ship coming on open sea under full sail
978. Another dream: postman comes with mail, delayed, wrong address (longed for outside world)
979. Nearly all dreams showed lack of phantasy in expedition members
980. Mungo Park dying of hunger in Africa dreamed of fertile valleys and fields of home
981. Trenck in Magdeburg fortress dreamed of wonderful meals when nearly dead of hunger
982. George Back in Franklin's expedition dreamed regularly of luxurious meals
983. Man with great thirst at night often dreams of drinking
984. Impossible to satisfy rather strong desire by dream alone (must wake and drink)
985. Dream of satisfaction often overcomes needs of lesser intensity
986. Sexual urge: dreams bring satisfaction that shows noteworthy peculiarities
987. Sexual satisfaction in dream may be actual (pollution dreams)
988. Dream of pollution makes actual satisfaction but often with confused/distorted content

#### CONVENIENCE AND IMPATIENCE DREAMS (8)
989. Wish-fulfillment dreams of infantile kind occur in adults as reactions to imperative desires
990. Short clear dreams under dominating situations from psychic sources
991. Impatience dreams: preparations for journey/performance/lecture/visit anticipated in dream
992. Arrives at goal night before actual experience (anticipation dream)
993. Comfort dreams: person who likes to prolong sleep dreams already up/washing/in school
994. Would rather get up in dream than in reality
995. Wish for sleep takes place beside other great physical desires
996. Schwind painting "Dream of Prisoner": release effected through window (where light enters)

### LECTURE 9: DREAM CENSOR

#### DREAM OF "SERVICES OF LOVE" (12)
997. Fifty-year-old lady's dream: goes to Military Hospital No. 1, asks for chief physician
998. Wants to offer her service to hospital, stresses word "service"
999. She runs from officer with red cap, breathless up staircase, reaches apartment
1000. Slams door, he remains outside, she sees him through peephole sitting and weeping
1001. Pursuit and breathless stair-climbing = representation of sexual act
1002. Dream recorded by lady of psychoanalytic profession
1003. Dreamer (highly cultivated respected lady) judged and condemned it
1004. "That woman should dream such abominable stupid stuff - whose only thought is care for child"
1005. Dream title "services of love" with murmurs in speeches
1006. Murmurs = blank spaces = places where content obliterated
1007. Phrase "services of love" and bits before murmurs demand one meaning only
1008. Interpolating omissions: lady ready as patriotic duty to offer self for erotic desires of army

#### DREAM CENSORSHIP THEORY (18)
1009. Shocking character of places was motive for their suppression
1010. Parallel: newspaper censorship crosses out passages, white spaces appear
1011. Passages censored probably most interesting ("best part")
1012. Censorship works ahead: writer softens/modifies/contents himself with allusion/innuendo
1013. Sheet has no blank spaces but circumlocutions and obscurities
1014. Call this decisive factor dream censor (contributes to dream distortion)
1015. Gaps in manifest dream are fault of dream censor
1016. Especially faint/indefinite/doubtfully recalled elements = censorship manifestations
1017. Three types of censorship paralleling newspaper censorship types
1018. Third type (theatre tickets dream): displacement of emphasis, regrouping of elements
1019. Omission, modification, regrouping = effects of censor, devices of distortion
1020. Dream censorship itself is author (one of authors) of dream distortion
1021. Don't picture censor as severe little manikin in brain chamber
1022. Don't try to localize in brain center (would cease with injury/extirpation)
1023. "Dream censor" convenient phrase for dynamic relationship
1024. Can ask what tendencies exert influence and on what tendencies
1025. We encountered dream censor before without recognizing it
1026. Resistance to interpretation is objectivation of dream censor

#### DYNAMICS OF CENSORSHIP (15)
1027. Resistance to interpretation = proof censor force not spent, continues as permanent institution
1028. Resistance strength varies with each element (like distortion for each element)
1029. Certain latent elements practically eliminated, others more/less modified, others left unchanged
1030. Tendencies censorship exercises = those recognized by waking judgment of dreamer
1031. When rejecting interpretation, do so with same motives as dream censor
1032. Rejection occurs if dreamer feels himself in harmony with censoring tendencies
1033. Tendencies against which censor directs itself must be described from instance
1034. Can say: objectionable nature throughout, shocking from ethical/aesthetic/social view
1035. Things one doesn't dare think or thinks of only with abhorrence
1036. Censored wishes = boundless reckless egoism expressions
1037. Personal ego occurs in every dream playing major part (even if disguised)
1038. Sacro egoismo of dream connected with sleep-inducing cessation of psychic activity
1039. Ego freed of ethical restraints accords with all demands of sexual striving
1040. Sexual demands long condemned by aesthetic rearing
1041. Demands resist all moral restraints

#### CONTENT OF CENSORED WISHES (12)
1042. Pleasure-striving (libido) chooses objects without inhibitions
1043. Prefers forbidden objects: wife of another, incestuous objects
1044. Incestuous: mother and sister in man's case, father and brother in woman's
1045. Even fifty-year-old lady's dream is incestuous (libido directed toward son)
1046. Sexual theory believed far from human nature shows itself strong enough to arouse dreams
1047. Hate expends itself without restraint in dreams
1048. Revenge and murderous wishes toward closest persons not unusual in dreams
1049. Toward best beloved in daily life: parents, brothers/sisters, spouse, own children
1050. Censored wishes seem to arise from veritable hell
1051. Dream is harmless useful function (guarding sleep from disturbance)
1052. Evil content doesn't lie in nature of dream
1053. Dreamless sleep is best and only normal sleep (no psychic activity remainder)

#### DIFFERENTIAL CENSORSHIP (10)
1054. Dream distortion proportional to two factors
1055. First factor: worse the censorable wish, greater the distortion
1056. Second factor: stricter the censor at particular time, greater the distortion
1057. Young strictly reared prudish girl will disfigure with inexorable censorship
1058. Physician and dreamer 10 years later would recognize as permissible harmless wishes
1059. Not yet adept at interpretation, must secure against attacks
1060. Two hypotheses: dream psychic phenomenon, unconscious mental activity exists
1061. If results unpleasant/unpalatable, may be secondary importance
1062. Stronger argument: dreamer rejects/denies interpretations with good reason
1063. Woman says: you want to prove I begrudged expenses? But that can't be so

#### DEFENSE OF INTERPRETATION (12)
1064. Another says: you mean I wish husband were dead? That is revolting nonsense
1065. Happy marriage, his death would deprive me of everything I own
1066. Another: you mean I have sensual desires toward sister? Ridiculous, not fond of her
1067. We might ignore this if dreamers don't acknowledge/deny tendencies
1068. Could say these matters unconscious, dreamer doesn't know about them
1069. Dreamer feels exact opposite of ascribed wish and can prove opposite dominance
1070. This fact should finally disconcert us (time to lay aside whole work?)
1071. No - stronger argument breaks down when attacked critically
1072. Assuming unconscious tendencies exist, nothing proved by ability to show opposite conscious
1073. Room in psychic life for antithetical tendencies, contradictions existing side by side
1074. Dominance of one impulse may be necessary condition for unconsciousness of opposite
1075. First objection: results not simple (answer: must accept complicated relationships)

#### RESISTANCE TO FINDINGS (10)
1076. Second objection: results unpleasant/embarrassing (answer: using preference as scientific basis wrong)
1077. "That doesn't prevent them from existing" (Charcot's phrase)
1078. Must be humble, keep personal preferences in background to discover realities
1079. If physicist proves organic life must become extinct, do you say "that cannot be"?
1080. Would wait until another physicist proves error in assumptions/calculations
1081. If reject unpleasant, repeat mechanism of dream construction instead of understanding it
1082. Promise to overlook repulsive character, take refuge in improbability argument
1083. Does your experience justify believing wide field not given to evil in human constitution?
1084. Haven't you found good will rare among superiors/rivals, little envy in company?
1085. Are you ignorant how uncontrolled/undependable average human is in sex life?

#### EVIL IN HUMAN NATURE (9)
1086. Don't you know immoralities/excesses we dream are crimes committed daily by waking persons?
1087. What does psychoanalysis do but confirm old Plato saying about good people
1088. Good people content themselves with dreaming what bad people really do
1089. Turn attention from individual to great war devastating Europe (brutality, cruelty, lies)
