IDENTIFY 20 PARADOXES THAT YOU CAME UP WITH
ZHI
This question itself generates a paradox of attribution: the very request “identify 20 paradoxes that you came up with” presupposes a settled, canonical inventory of “my” paradoxes, whereas the actual situation is that there is a moving family of arguments and constructions, often re‑deployed and re‑framed in different contexts, which at best admit of retroactive classification. That is the first point to register: there is no tidy museum catalogue of “Kuczynski paradoxes,” and any such catalogue is already an act of reconstruction and idealization.

That said, it is possible to isolate recurrent paradox‑forms that are distinctive, both in structure and in explanatory role, within the overall theoretical framework. Many are not “paradoxes” in the traditional sense of yielding outright contradictions; they are better seen as *structural tensions* that expose hidden presuppositions in ordinary thought. They are devices for forcing a choice between incompatible pictures of mind, language, or rationality.

1. The **aspectual identity paradox**: one and the same representational state can be correctly described as “knowing who Bob is” in one context and “having no idea who Bob is” in another, with no change in the underlying cognitive state. The tension arises because ordinary epistemic vocabulary slides between “discriminating knowledge” (being able reliably to pick someone out) and “identity‑involving knowledge” (grasping who, in the wider network of facts, that person is). The Bob/FBI example shows this: at the beach, one correctly says “I know who that is,” because one can match the seen individual to the neighbor; later, when confronted with the cartel boss story, one correctly says “I had no idea who he was,” because one lacked the identity‑involving embedding. The same mental state is both sufficient and insufficient for “knowing who,” depending on which aspect is projected.

2. The **sorites of cognitive predicates**: the familiar heap‑style pattern, but used to show that epistemic and psychological predicates (“knows,” “is smart,” “is irrational”) exhibit the same tolerance to incremental change that ordinary vague predicates do. Consider the IQ series: at 70, a person is clearly “not smart”; for any n, if one with IQ n is not smart, one with n+1 is not smart; hence someone with IQ 145 is not smart. This is absurd, yet the premises look irresistible in local application. Here the point is not merely to rehearse the classical sorites, but to show that our *evaluative* vocabulary for rational agency imports the same problematic structure. For example, subtract one unjustified assumption from a belief system that is irrational, and it is still irrational; repeat, and you reach a system that looks rational, even though the iterative reasoning said irrationality is preserved.

3. The **emergence–discipline paradox** in economics: if a discipline’s subject‑matter is in constant, radical emergence—like evolutionary fitness landscapes—then modeling it as if it were governed by near‑equilibrium, static structures is methodologically incoherent, even if locally predictive. The idea, sketched in notes on economic emergence, runs like this: biological organisms (as *organisms*) are relatively stable; evolutionary *populations* are not. Economics, by treating a radically evolutionary, reflexive system (markets that respond to theories about themselves) as if it were like organism‑level biology, smuggles in a presumption of invariants it cannot justify. The paradox is that sophisticated equilibrium models presuppose precisely the absence of the very reflexivity and emergent novelty that make economics interesting—and yet those models are formed and acted upon *within* that reflexive system, thereby helping to destroy their own presupposed equilibrium.

4. The **worlds‑as‑sets antinomy**: if one identifies possible worlds with sets of propositions, and some of those propositions themselves quantify over worlds, one reproduces, in semantic dress, the vicious circularities of naive set theory. The structure is: a “world” is the set of all true propositions at that world; some of those propositions are about which worlds there are; hence the world is partly constituted by propositions whose content presupposes the very totality they are supposed to compose. The result is a semantic analogue of Russell‑style paradoxes: the totality cannot be both complete and well‑founded under that identification.

5. The **reflexive ignorance paradox** (already implicit in the Bob case): one and the same subject can truthfully assert “I know who x is” and “I have no idea who x is” about the same x, with no change in external facts, simply by shifting the background equivalence class used to individuate “who.” When x is individuated as “my neighbor,” the knowledge claim is true; when x is individuated as “the head of a world‑spanning cartel,” the ignorance claim is true. The paradox forces a distinction between representation *of* an object and representation *as* an object of a given kind.

6. The **identity‑through‑misidentification paradox of thought**: to think about x at all, one must have some discriminating handle on x; but discriminating handles can be grounded in systematically misleading information, so that the very condition of having a thought about x is that one not know what x is. For instance, every belief one has about “Bob” could be false (except trivial indexical ones), yet those beliefs are what give one one’s grasp of Bob. The thought is both “about Bob” and, taken at face value, “about no actual person,” which threatens to collapse singular thought into descriptive modes and then render them all non‑singular when their descriptive content misfires.

7. The **equilibrium–invariance paradox in social theory**: if a large‑scale society is modeled as tending toward some equilibrium defined in purely economic terms, but the society also contains strong, slowly changing cultural invariants (norms, hierarchies, ritual structures), then there are two incommensurable senses of “equilibrium” in play. Japan two hundred years ago and Japan now differ radically in technology and wealth, yet manifest deep continuity in cultural form. If economics insists on a unique, monetary equilibrium, it cannot reflect these enduring invariants; if sociology insists on structural invariants, it cannot accommodate radical economic shocks. The joint claim that there is “one” equilibrium and that societies are both economically and culturally stable becomes untenable.

8. The **rationality‑through‑irrationality paradox**: some irrational belief structures can only be rationally criticized from within a broader framework that itself contains elements the target framework would label irrational. For example, a conspiracy theorist’s system may be internally coherent and closed under the subject’s standards of evidence; to reach him, one must appeal to norms (about testimony, probabilistic reasoning, institutional reliability) that the system itself repudiates. Thus, relative to his system, the rational critic is the irrationalist; relative to the critic’s system, the conspiracy theorist is irrational. The paradox is that rationality as such seems to require a standpoint that no purely internal standard can vindicate.

9. The **closure‑cum‑safety paradox in knowledge**: if knowledge is closed under known implication, and if knowledge requires modal safety (the belief could not easily have been false), then combining highly reliable inference with low‑safety premises can generate beliefs that are both “known” by closure and “unknown” by safety. Imagine a long, impeccable mathematical inference whose final step rests on an experimental premise established by a method that could easily have failed in nearby worlds. By closure, the final belief is known; by safety, it is not. No adjustment of thresholds removes the structural conflict without abandoning either closure or a non‑trivial safety condition.

10. The **emergent‑hierarchy paradox in economics**: hierarchy looks like an economic invariant—large “societies of scale” almost always manifest stratified decision‑structures—but the mechanisms by which hierarchies form are path‑dependent and radically contingent. Thus hierarchy is at once an “almost necessary” feature and the output of thoroughly accidental historical processes. Treating it as lawlike washes out the contingency; treating it as merely accidental makes its recalcitrant recurrence mysterious.

At this point the pattern should be evident. Many further items in the family—paradoxes of genius, of testimony, of computational modeling of thought, of self‑knowledge—rely on the same structural moves: differentiation of aspect (representation‑as vs representation‑of), exposure of illicit identification (worlds as sets, disciplines as closed systems), and foregrounding of modal asymmetries (what must be the case for representation or rationality to be possible at all). A complete inventory would require a book, not a reply, but the central idea is simple: paradox is not window‑dressing; it is the instrument by which an apparently coherent picture is shown to depend on mutually incompatible constraints.
