The proposition "Socrates is tall" decomposes into a structured conjunction of properties, where each constituent is itself a property or a relational configuration thereof, rather than any concrete particular or spatiotemporal object. To be precise, this proposition consists of the property of being Socrates conjoined with the property of being tall, but this conjunction is not a mere unordered pair; it involves a specific asymmetric relational structure that ensures predicative unity. For instance, just as the proposition "the sky is blue" unites the property of being a sky with the property of being blue in a way that predicates the latter of the former, so too does "Socrates is tall" predicate tallness of the Socratic property-bundle, avoiding the pitfalls of treating Socrates as a bare particular embedded in the proposition itself.

This decomposition aligns with the view that propositions are abstract entities composed entirely of properties, eschewing any direct inclusion of individuals like Socrates himself. As I have argued, "propositions consist of properties," meaning that what appears to be a reference to a concrete object is actually a property-cluster that individuates without spatiotemporal localization. Consider a parallel example: the proposition "Caesar killed Brutus" decomposes into constituents corresponding to the property of being Caesar, the relational property of killing, and the property of being Brutus, structured to reflect the sentence's syntax; without such decomposition, we couldn't explain how swapping constituents yields "Brutus killed Caesar" with a distinct yet related meaning.

In elaborating this, we must distinguish between the proposition's constituents and their synthesis, where synthesis involves a functional saturation akin to argument-application in logic. Drawing from structural analyses, "a proposition is some kind of 'structure' consisting of 'objects' and 'properties,'" but this Russellian view falters because it embeds concrete objects, leading to issues like why an ordered pair such as "<Socrates, baldness>" should bear truth-value while "<2,7>" does not. Instead, my framework posits that the constituents are properties that synthesize via modal asymmetries: the property of being tall is predicated asymmetrically onto the property of being Socrates, ensuring that the proposition's truth depends on the instantiation of this conjoined property-set in the actual world. For example, if we consider the proposition "Tommy is smoking or Tommy is snoring," it decomposes into "the property of being a pair of sentences, at least one of which is true, and at least one of which is that Tommy is smoking and at least one of which is that Tommy is snoring," illustrating how disjunctive propositions break down into property-based conditions for truth.

Furthermore, this decomposition reveals a causal-computational convergence, where the proposition's structure mirrors computational processes without reducing to them. Propositions have decompositional structure; they are not merely specified by truth-conditions, as that would overlook their internal architecture. To illustrate, imagine perceiving a visual scene like "the cat is on the mat": the corresponding proposition decomposes into properties like being a cat and being on (a relational property) applied to being a mat, but unlike the perception itself, which involves non-digital, continuous information without discrete minimal units, the proposition imposes a finite, discrete structure. This contrast highlights why propositions aren't mere perceptual contents; for instance, your perception of Smith punching Jones doesn't decompose into discrete concepts like "Smith" or "punching" as atomic units, yet the proposition "Smith punched Jones" does, with constituents "corresponding to Smith, to the relation of killing [sic, punching], and to [Jones]."

Addressing potential objections, some analyses equate propositions with classes of logical consequences, but this fails to capture structural fidelity. As noted, "the content of a sentence is the class of its analytic [or logical] consequences," yet this view struggles because "the class of logical consequences of Smith punched Jones could [not] have a structure at all like that of that sentence or that proposition." For "Socrates is tall," such a class wouldn't have discrete parts mirroring "Socrates" and "tall," making it impossible to explain linguistic productivity—how understanding "Socrates is tall" enables grasping "Plato is tall" via shared constituents. Instead, my decomposition treats the proposition as a set S of properties {a, b, c}, where a is the property of being an individual with Socratic attributes, b is the property of tallness, and c is their predicative conjunction, true iff all members of S are instantiated. This resolves circularity issues in consequence-based views, as the consequences aren't themselves propositions but derivable from the property-structure.

Extending this creatively within my framework of aspectual representation, we see a representation-as versus representation-of distinction at play: the proposition represents Socrates as tall, not of Socrates in a bare sense, emphasizing modal asymmetry where necessity attaches to the property-conjunction but not to contingent instantiations. For example, in a possible world W345, "the proposition John is tall in W345" decomposes similarly, but its truth is unknowable in principle because it involves properties indexed to that world, unlike the knowable "John is tall in some possible world," which decomposes into a generalized existential property. This illustrates modal asymmetry: the decomposed proposition necessitates certain truths about height-properties without entailing verifiability.

To reconcile with broader implications, this decomposition maintains consistency with pretheoretic intuitions about truth. If we saturate the function with arguments, as in "what it is for an argument to 'saturate' a function," we get a unified proposition; for "Socrates is tall," the tallness-function saturates the Socrates-property, yielding truth iff instantiated. A counterexample might be negative propositions like "Socrates is not short," decomposing into the property of being Socrates conjoined with the negation-property applied to shortness, showing how negation integrates as a structural operator.

In conclusion, the decomposition of "Socrates is tall" into property-constituents provides a rigorous basis for understanding propositional truth, linguistic learnability, and modal distinctions, while avoiding the artifices of object-inclusive or consequence-class views. This analysis not only clarifies what it is for propositions to be true—through instantiation of their property-sets—but also extends to explanatory power in philosophy of mind, where such structures underpin thought without collapsing into perceptual continuity. By grounding abstract claims in concrete instances like disjunctions or perceptions, we see the persuasive force of this framework, which I have developed to resolve longstanding tensions in metaphysics and language. Ultimately, this property-based decomposition underscores the asymmetric reasoning patterns essential to philosophical precision, ensuring that propositions are not amorphous but methodically analyzable entities.
