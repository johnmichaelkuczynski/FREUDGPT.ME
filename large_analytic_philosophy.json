Alternatively, it’s a way of saying this property doesn’t have any instances—that it’s uninstantiated. (II) is a way of saying that anything having the property of being a square lacks the property of being a circle. Alternatively, it’s a way of saying that these two properties don’t have any instances in common—that they are not coinstantiated.(i) and (ii) thus attribute properties to properties. They say, respectively, that the property of being both a square and a circle is uninstantiated and that the properties of being a square and of being a circle are not coinstantiated. Since (i) and (ii) are just different ways of saying what SC says, the latter doesn’t make the absurd statement that some non-entity is a circle, and it instead makes the innocuous statement that the set of squares doesn’t overlap with the set of circles or, alternatively, that the property of being a square circle is uninstantiated. What this shows is that, in at least some cases, philosophical insight is acquired, not by doing parascience, but by analyzing meanings—not by positing entities, but by clarifying statements.7 Analytic philosophy is philosophy that is driven by accep-tance of FL. Let us now expand on FL and make it clear why it’s true.",

    "text": "isn’t any one person to whom SS attributes the property of smoking. This is easily shown.9 If Smith smokes, the sentence: “someone smokes but Smith does not” will be false. But it won’t be self-contradictory; it won’t be like “Smith smokes but Smith does not smoke.” (For a statement to be self-contradictory is for it to bear two mutually opposed meanings.) Of course, there isn’t anything special about the name “Smith,” what we just said could have been said in connection with Jones or Brown or any other expression that refers to some individual. Thus, there is no individual N such that it is self-contradictory to say that someone smokes but N does not. Therefore “someone” doesn’t refer to anyone. “But you’ve misunderstood my thesis” it will be said. “The word “someone” doesn’t unambiguously pick out an ambiguous person. It is itself ambiguous. It refers to Fred and Ethel and Mary. It refers to all people indifferently.” That’s false. “Someone” isn’t ambiguous; it isn’t like the word “dumb.” SS has one meaning, unlike “John is dumb,” which could mean either “John is unintelligent” or “John is mute.” Also, if “someone” were ambiguous between “John” and “Ethel” and so on, then, depending on the circumstances, it would be synonymous with “John smokes” or “Ethel smokes.” And in that case, “someone smokes, but John does not” would sometimes have the same meaning as “John smokes but John does not smoke,” in which case it would be self-contradictory. But, as we just saw, “someone smokes, but John does not” is not self-contradictory under any circumstances. If John does smoke, it will be false, but it won’t be self-contradictory. Also, it isn’t clear what it means to say that “someone” picks out everyone “indifferently.” But if, as is surely the case, picking out everyone indifferently involves picking out everyone, then it’s just wrong to say that “someone” picks out everyone “indifferently” (or in any other way). For if it did, it would have the same meaning as “everyone,” which it doesn’t.",

    "text": "is just like that of (JTM) “John has run a three-minute mile.” JTM clearly attributes that property to an individual. That isn’t what TM does. TM says of that property that it can’t be attributed to anyone. So TM says that (“UP” is short for “uninstantiated property”): (UP) the property of being a person who has run a three-minute mile is uninstantiated. Notice that UP’s grammatical form is the opposite of TM’s. The grammatical subject of TM is “nobody”; the grammatical predicate is “has run a three-minute mile.” By contrast, the grammatical subject of UP is “the property of being a person who has run a three-minute mile,” which corresponds to “has run a three-minute mile,” and the grammatical predicate of UP is uninstantiated, which corresponds to “nobody.” If one were to take TM at face value, and were thus to assume that its meaning paralleled that of JTM, one would have to say that it attributed the property of being a person who has run a three-minute mile to some un-person, or some such. But if this is what it said, then in order to be true, somebody—namely, this unperson— would have had to run a three-minute mile, in which case TM would be false. When we align TM’s real meaning with its grammar, we don’t have to swallow this rank absurdity. For UP says of some very much existent property (that of being a person who has run a three-minute mile) that it has a certain very much existent property (that of being uninstantiated). So we get the right result if we do linguistic analysis. We get the wrong result if we do para-science—if, that is, we posit new entities in order to account for the datum that TM is true. The same thing is true of: (NS) “nothing smokes.” Pre-Fregeans said that NS says of some non-thing—some blank entity—that it smokes. So, supposing that in 500 years nobody smokes, and that NS is therefore true, it will be in virtue of the fact that some blank entity is around that is smoking. But if there is such a thing, and it’s smoking, then NS is false. As long as one thing smokes, NS is false. It doesn’t matter how blank or otherwise deficient that thing is. Frege straightened this all out. By obvious extensions of what we just said, NS’s real meaning is: (NS2) the property of...",

    "text": "To be sure, there are non-mental things (e.g., deposits of ink or pain) that are representational. Utterances and ink deposits are representational, even though they aren’t mental. But this isn’t a threat to Brentano’s position. Utterances (etc.) are representational only in a derivative sense. It’s because we endow it with meaning that an utterance of “snow is white” is meaningful; in a world devoid of sentient beings, it would just be another noise. So Brentano’s thesis is that for something to be mental is for it to be non-derivatively representational. There is an apparent problem with Brentano’s thesis. To be representational is presumably to represent something. Hallucinations are mental entities. But what does a hallucination of a pink elephant represent? A pink elephant? No—pink elephants don’t exist. More formally, there is nothing x such that x is a pink elephant. A fortiori there is nothing x such that x is a pink elephant that is represented by some hallucination. Still, there is clearly a sense in which hallucinations of pink elephants and other non-entities are representational. How is this to be explained? The solution to this problem lies in the fact that perception is description. If you’re looking at an actual elephant, which we’ll call “Larry,” the information encoded in your visual perception isn’t the effect that: (LP13) Larry is standing over there, next to that tree, looking ill [etc.]. When you look at an elephant, or a person, or a rock, you don’t just see that object. Seeing Larry involves seeing a thing having various properties—having a certain color, shape, size, position (relative to you), etc. So seeing Larry involves seeing that various properties are instantiated—that there is an instance, in a certain place, of a certain morphology, color, etc. Perceptions of things aren’t like sentences about them. In the sentence: (LS14) “Larry is standing over there, next to that tree, looking ill [etc.]” Larry is represented by a single, semantically simple symbol (namely, “Larry”).15 But in no sense-perception of Larry is he represented by some simple, homogenous, non-composite cipher. So far as he is perceived, Larry is represented as having these or those properties. This means that seeing him involves seeing that these or those properties are instantiated. It’s not as though in addition to seeing an instance of a certain morphology, color, etc., you also, separately from that, see Larry.16 No, your seeing Larry consists in your...",

On this occasion, the message—the existence-claim—in question is false, the reason being that nothing satisfies it. (Yesterday, the message represented by your visual experience was correct, the reason being that the existence-claim in question was satisfied.) The important point is that, although it was hallucinatory, your visual experience encoded an existence-claim and, in so doing, gave you a message and was therefore representational. It wasn’t representational in the sense that there was some thing that it picked out and, for that reason, represented. It was representational in the sense that it gave you a message, albeit a false one, and thus represented the world as being a certain way. Your visual perception of yesterday, unlike your visual perception of today, encoded a true existence-claim. But your visual experience of today no more represents some non-existent entity than your sense-perception yesterday. Your visual experience today has for its content a false proposition to the effect that there is a thing having thus and such properties. But just as the sentence “there does not exist a ten-foot tall man” does not, in order to be true, require the existence of a ten-foot tall man, so your perception doesn’t require the existence of an elephant before you. The same thing is true of thoughts about the non-existent. When you think about some non-existent number—for example, an even prime greater than two—there isn’t some mathematically impossible entity that you’re cognitively locking onto. What’s going on is that you’re thinking some false existence-claim along the lines of: there is some number n such that n is both even and prime [etc.]. Mental entities have propositions for their contents. When correct, those propositions describe existing things. When false, they don’t. But nothing non-existent or quasi-existent can be the object of a thought or perception. When we describe a thought or perception as having a “non-existent object,” what we mean, so far as what we mean is coherent, is that it has for its content an existence-claim that nothing satisfies. But Brentano dropped the ball. He realized that hallucinations are, in some significant sense, representational. Wishing to reconcile this with the fact that there are no pink elephants (etc.), he said that a hallucination of a pink elephant has a non-existent...",

But if a light beam rushes past you at a rate of 186,000 miles/second, and I rush past you at a rate of 180,000 miles/second, the light beam rushes past me at a rate of 186,000 miles/second. There is thus is no optical test for determining one’s own state of motion.19 In other words, no matter how quickly you travel, you will not be able to detect any change in your velocity relative to that of a light beam. People and instruments not traveling with you will be able to detect changes in your velocity relative to that of a light beam, and you will be able to detect changes in their velocities relative to that of a light beam. But nobody can detect any changes in his own velocity relative to that of a light beam. This deeply puzzling fact was established in 1879. But nobody had any idea how to explain it until, in 1905, Einstein put forth the Special Theory of Relativity. Einstein didn’t cite any data that hadn’t been available to the physics community for decades. Einstein’s great innovation was of a conceptual nature. The facts were in, but he was the first to make sense of them. Be all of this as it may, Relativity Theory is an empirical theory. It’s based on observational and experimental data, much of which would be impossible to acquire except through carefully executed experiments. This data wasn’t in until 1879. So even though nobody came up with Relativity Theory before 1879, that fact can’t be chalked up to the fact that nobody drew the right inferences. It is due, at least in part, to the fact that the necessary data simply wasn’t available. (What can be chalked up to a failure to draw the right inferences is the fact that, during the period from 1879 to 1905, nobody came up with Relativity Theory.) In general, scientific breakthroughs have two components: (i) a strictly fact-based component (new raw data is acquired), and (ii) a purely conceptual component (already known data is modeled in a new and better way). 4.1 Empirical puzzles vs. philosophical puzzles (continued) Unlike scientific puzzles, philosophical puzzles are not solved by generating new raw data.

There are many philosophical puzzles that don’t have anything to do with language, and the solutions to these puzzles cannot be modeled on Frege’s solutions to the puzzles discussed a moment ago. Here’s an example from epistemology.24 You couldn’t see the book in front of you were it not for the disturbances of your eyes brought about by the light-rays bouncing off of it. In general, nothing can sense-perceive anything that doesn’t affect it. All knowledge of what is in space-time is rooted in sense-perception. (If it’s in space-time, it isn’t known unless it’s directly perceived or evidence of it is perceived.) Taking it for granted that nothing that isn’t space-time can possibly be known, many contemporary epistemologists, e.g. Jerry Fodor25, hold that one can’t know of anything without being affected by it. Thus, such philosophers hold that: (JK) John’s being aware of the fact that 1 + 1 = 2 involves his being on the receiving end of some causal process initiated by that fact. I personally regard JK as being absurd in the extreme.26 The fact that 1 + 1 = 2 isn’t comparable to the fact that there is a book in front of you. Were mass-energy distributed differently, there wouldn’t be a book in front of you. But 1+1 would equal 2 no matter how mass-energy were distributed. Thus, “1 + 1 = 2” says nothing about how mass-energy is distributed, and it therefore says nothing about the spatiotemporal world. The fact it describes must therefore be non-spatiotemporal. Nothing outside of space-time can bear any causal relation to anything. Therefore, JK is wrong.27 In any case, the dispute between those who accept JK and those who reject it has nothing to do with language. It’s agreed what JK means. What isn’t agreed is whether the thing that it’s agreed to mean is true. But the controversies surrounding NS do concern language; they concern the semantics of the word “nothing.” Those who see “nothing” as being a referring term, like “Socrates,” see NS as saying that some featureless entity smokes. Those who deny that “nothing” and “Socrates” belong to the same semantic category don’t see NS as saying this. Therein lies the controversy. Nothing comparable to this holds in connection with JK. Analytic philosophers do agree that the right way to figure out whether or not JK is correct is by carefully...",

Linguists, on the other hand, are interested in those concepts only to the extent that an understanding of them will help them understand specific sentences, such as NS. Frege did indeed painstakingly analyze specific sentences. But he did so only because he knew that, by so doing, he could identify general logical principles. Thus, for Frege, his insight that logical and grammatical form pull apart was ultimately just a means to an end, the end being the identification of the actual nature of the bearing- relations that propositions have with respect to one another. So, yes, analytic philosophy is statement-analysis; and, yes, it was Frege’s brilliant analyses of sentences that availed philosophers of the principles needed to analyze statements properly.

    "text": "This contention is incoherent on many levels. Given only the acoustical and morphological properties of its spoken and written occurrences, the word “knowledge” could mean anything.37 So, supposing that it’s the concept of knowledge that we wish to learn about, we can’t possibly know that the word “knowledge” is the right word to study unless we know that it expresses the right concept. But we can’t possibly know that unless we have some way of grasping that concept that doesn’t involve that word. So we can’t even act on Wittgenstein’s exhortation that we study knowledge by studying how people use the word “knowledge” unless we have some way of grasping the concept of knowledge that doesn’t involve that word. But if we don’t need that word to grasp that concept, we don’t need it to it study it; and if we don’t need it to study it, then Wittgenstein is simply wrong to say that one must study how it is used to understand the concept it expresses. Given any expression E and any concept C, an obvious extension of this argument shows that one can’t learn about C by studying E unless one can grasp C, and can therefore examine it, without E’s help. Thus, Wittgenstein is simply wrong to contend that one learns about concepts by learning about how the corresponding words are used. “But you’ve over-stated what Wittgenstein is claiming,” it will be said. “Contrary to what you allege, he wasn’t saying that concepts are to be learned about solely by looking at how the corresponding words are typically used. He was saying only that knowledge of expression-usage would be a useful adjunct to some other, more important way of knowing about concepts.” If that’s what Wittgenstein is saying, then he’s conceding everything said the preceding paragraph.38 To grant that there is any expression-independent way of grasping concepts is to grant that expression-usage is to be evaluated in light of the very conceptual knowledge that, according to Wittgenstein’s thesis, one is supposed to acquire through the study of expression-usage. But there’s a problem with our argument. It assumes that, given a meaningful expression (e.g. “knowledge”), there is some object that is its meaning. Wittgenstein rejects this assumption. He holds that there is no entity that is the meaning of “knowledge.” Wittgenstein’s position is, I quote, that “meaning is use.”39 In other words, for an expression to have...",

Were WA cogent, Wittgenstein would be doing to meanings what Frege did to square circles. Frege got rid of square circles by showing that sentences appearing to require their existence (e.g. “square circles simultaneously have, and lack, uniform curvatures”) are equivalent to sentences that don’t (e.g. “the statement x is a circle entails x has a uniform curvature and the statement x is a square entails x does not have a uniform curvature”). Wittgenstein wishes to get rid of meanings by showing that statements appearing to require the existence of expression-meanings are equivalent to statements (about expression-usage) that don’t. This wish of Wittgenstein’s embodies some very wrong views as to what linguistic expressions are. A burst of noise that doesn’t have a meaning is just a burst of noise. A burst of noise is an expression only if it has a meaning. But if it already has a meaning, then how it’s being used isn’t what gives it its meaning. Our knowledge of what words mean is what guides our linguistic behavior. Expressions have meanings. We know this. And that’s why we use expressions in the way we do. I know what “hug” means; I also know what “discuss” means. That’s why, when talking to my students, I say “I want to discuss the exam,” and not “I want to hug the exam.” If meaning were use, meaning couldn’t guide use. But it obviously does. To the extent that meaning doesn’t guide use, people are misspeaking. Wanting to tell you that you’re an absolute genius, I say “you’re an absolute moron,” since, despite my generally good command of the English language, I wrongly think that “moron” means genius. To the extent that my uttering those words embodied a failure to know the actual meaning of what I was saying—to the extent that meaning failed to guide use, in other words—I misspoke. And to the extent that my uttering those words embodied a knowledge of what they meant—to the extent that meaning did guide use, in other words—I spoke properly. This shows that, to the extent that utterances aren’t simply defective, meaning guides use and, consequently, that use is not constitutive of meaning.

So I wasn’t saying anything.43 And as we saw earlier, I am misspeaking if I misidentify the meaning assigned by existing semantic rules to the noises I am making. So there is no bona fide speech where there isn’t awareness of semantic rules. Thus, the analysis of sentences isn’t the analysis of noises. (In this context, take references to “noises” to be short for references to anything that can constitute the occurrence of an expression—e.g., hand-movements, patterns of light on a monitor, etc.) In and of themselves, noises aren’t speech, as we just saw. It is only when a noise embodies an attempt to follow a semantic rule that it constitutes speech. So the analysis of speech—that is, of spoken sentences—concerns noises only to the extent that they embody attempts to follow such rules; and for the same reason mutatis mutandis, the analysis of sentences per se, as opposed to their spoken (or written) occurrences, necessarily involves, if it doesn’t coincide with, the analysis of those rules. Those rules are not themselves sentences. The semantic rule that assigns meaning to “snow is white” is not itself a sentence.44 Given these points, what might it mean to say that philosophy is sentential analysis? It could mean that philosophy is the empirical study of different languages, i.e., that philosophy is linguistics. But that clearly isn’t what philosophy is. So it must mean that philosophy is the study of semantic rules qua semantic rules—that, in other words, it is the study of the concept of a semantic rule. In that case, philosophy is also the study of those concepts that must be understood to understand the concept of a semantic rule. And there are many such concepts. Among them are narrowly semantic concepts such as compositionality, reference, quantification, force, and negation. But many of these concepts aren’t only of relevance to semantics. As we’ve seen, no noise constitutes a sentence-utterance unless it embodies an intention of a certain kind; and there is no linguistic behavior of any kind where people aren’t intentionally following what they believe to be existing semantic rules.

BG is obviously meaningless. The reason for this is that it’s syntactically ill-formed. If we produced only syntactically well-formed sentences, we wouldn’t produce nonsense like BG. Since all philosophical statements are in the same class as BG, we’d never produce any sentences whose merits it was the job of philosophy to determine.

Although TA is a paraphrase, not a quotation, the part in quotes is an exact quotation from the TLP.47 What Wittgenstein is saying isn’t confined to the defensible claim that philosophical problems are to be solved by clarifying statements. Wittgenstein is making two additional claims. First, no sentence that appears to make a philosophical statement means anything. Second, it’s only because they’re syntactically ill-formed that such sentences are meaningless—there is no other reason. Let us evaluate these claims. Though ungrammatical, the sentence: (MH) “me and Herby play tennis every day, and me always win because Herby not in good shape” is perfectly meaningful. Ungrammatical statements are often meaningful. Thus, BG’s failure to mean anything cannot be entirely blamed on its being ungrammatical. What’s the real problem with BG? The expression “more identical than” is obviously supposed to function in the same way as relational expressions, like “more important than” or “identical with.” But there is no relation that it picks out. Though it consists of English expressions, the expression “more identical than” is itself no more a part of the English lexicon than “blurga derba gurb.” For that reason, the meaninglessness of BG is to be accounted for in the same way as the meaninglessness of: (BG#) “the beautiful is blurga derba gurb the good.” The problem with BG# is that “blurga derba gurb” doesn’t mean anything. It may be that its meaninglessness is reflected in its syntax. It may be that because “blurga derba gurb” doesn’t mean anything, BG#’s syntax is off. But, if so,...",

But nothing that can meaningfully be said of non-properties, such as human beings, can be meaningfully said of properties themselves. Ryle’s position is false. There are many differences between people and properties. One of them is that people can dance, whereas properties cannot. Ryle’s position is also self-refuting. In saying that it cannot be said that properties cannot dance, Ryle is saying exactly what it is that, according to his theory, cannot be said. Ryle is confusing absurdity with meaninglessness. The sentence “triangles have four sides” makes an absurd, but meaningful, statement. Given that triangles have three sides, not four, it’s false. Given that it’s false, it’s meaningful. “Properties can dance” is absurd and, therefore, false and, therefore meaningful. There are two kinds of “nonsense.” A sentence can be nonsense by failing to have any meaning. (BG# is nonsense in this sense.) And a sentence can be nonsense by virtue of having of an absurd meaning. (“Properties can dance” is nonsense in this sense.) Ryle doesn’t distinguish between these two kinds of nonsense. Neither does Wittgenstein. And Wittgenstein’s position, like Ryle’s, is self-refuting—and for much the same reason. If Wittgenstein is right to say that all philosophical assertions are ungrammatical nonsense, that very assertion is ungrammatical nonsense and therefore isn’t true.50 Given how implausible and illogical it is, why on Earth did Wittgenstein hold that philosophical statements are always ungrammatical nonsense? The answer, I believe, is that Wittgenstein thought this view to be the distillation of Frege’s groundbreaking philosophical successes. Frege showed that reparsing sentences sometimes solves philosophical problems. By reparsing (NS) “nothing is a square circle,” we show that it doesn’t attribute the property of being a square circle to some non-entity, thereby dissolving an age-old riddle. Wittgenstein seems to have inferred from these successes of Frege’s that all philosophical problems are to be solved by reparsing sentences. This inference is fallacious. Given only that some philosophical problems are to be solved by reparsing sentences, it doesn’t follow that they are all to be solved in that way. And we’ve seen that, indeed, many of them are not to be solved in that way. Also, there were no cases where Frege’s reparsing of...",

This time, they said that a non-tautologous statement is meaningful if possible observations can confirm it. (P confirms Q if, other things being equal, Q is more likely to be true if P is true than if not-P is true. Other things being equal, Smith is more likely to be wealthy if he wears fancy clothes than if he doesn’t wear fancy clothes. Thus, “Smith wears fancy clothes” confirms “Smith is wealthy.”) We’ll refer to this view as “confirmationalism.” Confirmationalism is equivalent with the position that all meaningful non-tautologous statements are empirical. An empirical statement is one that, if true, expresses a truth that must be known through observation and that, if false, is the negation of a true empirical statement. “There are trees in Santa Barbara, CA” is a true empirical statement, and “there are no trees in Santa Barbara, CA” is a false one. The negation of an empirical statement is an empirical statement. This is becasue, if it’s an empirical question whether or not S is true, then it’s an empirical question whether or not S is false and, therefore, whether or not not-S is true. (There are, as we will see, very few truths, if any, that can be known strictly through observation. A statement is empirical if the truth or falsity of it is to be decided on grounds that are at least partly observational.) Henceforth when we refer to “logical positivism” (LP), we will refer to the position that a statement S is meaningful if and only if (i) S is a tautology (e.g., “sisters are female siblings”) or (ii) S is an empirical statement (e.g., “there are trees in Santa Barbara”).60",

And some authors, for this reason, would describe (4) itself, the sentence, as logically true. But what they mean is that, given what it is that it means, (4) must be true. So what they are in fact describing as logically true is the proposition that (4) couldn’t be false, given what it is that it means. Thus, it is always propositions, and never sentences, that are logically true. But no proposition is true by convention. It’s up to us what our symbols mean. But it’s not up to us whether those meanings are correct. It’s up to us what it is that “the moon is not made of cheese” means. But it isn’t up to us whether that meaning is correct. LP identifies logical truth with conventional truth: truths of logic are sentences that are true by convention. But that’s false. Logical truths are never sentences; they’re always propositions, and propositions are never conventionally true. Incidentally, (ii) collapses into (i). Linguistic conventions are known empirically. It can be known only through observation that “triangles have three sides” is true. That sentence could mean anything.62 It could mean that penguins are smarter than humans; and it’s only because you’ve had the requisite sense-perceptions that you know it not to mean this. It should be pointed out that logical positivists were unanimous in denying the existence of propositions and of meanings generally. Logical positivists didn’t accept the view that for a lecture to concern triangles is for the meaning of that lecture to concern triangles. This is why Rudolph Carnap63 (1890–1970), an LPhardliner for many years, said that for a lecture to concern triangles is for the word “triangle” to occur in the lecture. Carnap’s view is false. Many a lecture that doesn’t contain the word “triangle” concerns triangles. (Think of all the mathematics lectures given in Japanese, Swedish, and Arabic. How often does the word “triangle” occur in them?) And a lecture that contains the word “triangle” isn’t necessarily about triangles. Somebody giving a lecture on linguistics may use the word ‘triangle’ to illustrate some point about phonetics; but in so doing, that person isn’t talking about triangles. They’re talking, not about triangles, but about the word “triangle.” The distinction between the...",

A much better received attempt to do away with meanings is to be found in a doctrine known as conceptual role semantics (CRS). According to CRS, two sentences have the same meaning if, and only if, they are used in the same way. So “hace mucho calor” is the Spanish translation of “it’s hot” not because those sentences share a meaning—meanings don’t exist, according to CRS—but because the one sentence is used in the same way as the other.65 CRS seems to coincide with the Wittgenstein-Grice thesis that “meaning is use.” It’s thus a mystery why CRS is so popular, given that Grice’s coincident position was universally rejected long ago. In any case, CRS is indefensible. So far as she isn’t misspeaking or randomly barking out noises, anyone who says “it’s hot out” or “hace much calor,” or any other sentence, does so because she knows that existing semantic rules assign a certain proposition to those words and she wishes to put that proposition into words. One immediate consequence of this is that Carnap’s position is false. Another immediate consequence is that what it is for those two sentences to have the same meaning is not for them to be “used in the same way.” Also, given any natural language, there are infinitely many sentences belonging to it that have never been used. The thesis that sentences have the same meaning iff they’re used in the same way has the absurd consequence that any two sentences that haven’t been used before have the same meaning. (If two sentences aren’t used at all, they aren’t used differently, and are therefore used in the same way, if only in a vacuous sense.)",

    "text": "We’ll see this in this chapter when we discuss the brilliant criticisms of LP put forth by Carl Hempel (1905–1997), who was one of LP’s first and most ardent advocates. But erstwhile advocates of LP tended not to see the incoherence that lies at the center of that doctrine. When saying why they rejected LP, they usually cited narrow, technical problems of the sort just discussed. What they didn’t do, but what we’re about to do, is to say why LP is at its very core a broken and illogical doctrine.70 Anything that is true or false is meaningful. Truth implies meaningfulness and so does falsity. Thus, LP is meaningful if it’s correct. LP says that any meaningful statement is either a tautology or is empirical. So if LP is correct, it is itself either a tautology or it is empirical. It isn’t a matter of convention that the expression “meaningful sentence” is interchangeable with the expression “sentence that is either a tautology or is empirical.” Therefore, LP isn’t a tautology.71 Since it isn’t a tautology, LP is an empirical truth if it isn’t false. But LP isn’t an empirical truth. Any attempt to provide an observational basis for any statement presupposes the meaningfulness of that statement and thus presupposes an answer to the question “what conditions must a statement fulfill to be meaningful?” For this reason, the question “what conditions must a statement satisfy if it is to be meaningful?” isn’t empirical in nature. It follows that one cannot coherently attempt to find empirical grounds for accepting LP, since any attempt to do so itself presupposes the meaningfulness of LP. Thus, LP isn’t an empirical theory. Thus, LP is neither an empirical truth nor a tautology. It is thus a counterexample to itself and is therefore false. Interestingly, in the TLP, Wittgenstein seems to be aware that one cannot coherently say that there can be non-tautologous meaningful statements. Not a single one of the assertions in the TLP is empirical; and not a single one of them is a tautology. This means that, if the TLP's main thesis is correct, the TLP is nonsense. Wittgenstein acknowledges this. For he ends his book by saying that everything that he says in it is meaningless and that those points ought to be seen, not as truths, but as ladders that one can use to get to the truth but that, once...",

According to (2), ‹x is knowledge› is inconsistent with ‹x isn’t known through observation.› But, as we noted on page 24, observation cannot tell you whether one statement is consistent with some other statement. Thus, any body observational data is consistent with the assumption that empiricism is false. This means that there cannot be strictly observational grounds for believing empiricism correct. Thus, so far as empiricism is correct, there are no grounds for believing it correct; and so far as there are such grounds, empiricism is false. Thus, the likelihood that empiricism is correct is inversely proportional to the degree of probability that the information at our disposal confers on it. And this means that, if it’s a certainty that empiricism is correct, it’s a certainty that it’s false. Therefore, empiricism, if true, is false; therefore it’s false. The final sentence of a famous argument given by Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) ends with a sentence very similar to the last one. (This was deliberate.) The argument in question is to the effect that “naïve realism”—which is a specific, particularly extreme form of empiricism, and is therefore relevant in this context—is false: We all start from naïve realism, i.e., the doctrine that things are what they seem. We think that grass is green, that stones are hard, and that snow is cold. But physics assures us that the greenness of grass, the hardness of stones, and coldness of snow are not the greenness, hardness, and coldness that we know in our experience, but something very different. The observer, when he seems to himself to be observing a stone, is really, if physics is to be believed, observing the effects of the stone upon himself. Thus, science seems to be at war upon itself. When it most means to be objective, it finds itself plunged into subjectivity against its will. Naïve realism leads to physics; and physics, if true, shows that naïve realism is false. Therefore, naïve realism, if true, is false; therefore it’s false.73 Though eloquently stated, this argument consists of spurious reasoning for a false conclusion. In observing the paper-weight on my desk, I’m not observing some effect of the stone upon myself: I’m observing the stone itself. To be sure, my observing the stone is itself...",

Somewhat irritated, he says: (i) “there are three feet in a yard.” Under these circumstances, (i) is not trivial and, therefore, is not a tautology. It would be tautologous if you had learned the meaning of the word “yard” by being told that “yards are lengths of three feet.” But this isn’t how you were told it. You were shown a yard-long object and told that the word “yard” refers to its length. Obviously that visual perception did apprise you of that object’s length. But the way it described that length to you was different from the way that this same information would be conveyed to you by an utterance of: “the lenght of that object is one yard.” And given the information embodied in your visual perception’s of L and M, it wouldn’t be a trivial matter to know that the length described by the contents of your L-perceptions coincided with that described by your M-perceptions. Therefore, (i) would not, under those circumstances, express a tautology, at least not from your perspective. But it would express a tautology from the perspective of somebody to whom “yard” had initially been defined as “distance of three feet.” So even though it’s standard practice among philosophers to describe sentences as “tautologies,” this practice embodies a serious confusion. A given sentence may or may not be tautology, depending on the manner in which the auditor learned the meanings of its constituent expressions and depending, therefore, on the information on the basis of which the auditor knows those meanings.

For, contrary to what its advocates said, the problem with these so-called statements is not that they’re incapable of empirical corroboration. Consider the sentence: (i) “the universe is a perfect unity.” Much loved by many a freshman narco-intellectual, this is a meaningless sentence if ever there was one; and it is just the sort of sentence that logical positivists had in mind. But if it were said what exactly it means to describe something as a “perfect unity,” (i) would be meaningful, as it would then be true or false. If, by a “perfect unity”, one means an object that consists of events bearing a specified causal or logical relationship to one another, then (i) is either true or false, depending on the identity of that relationship. For example, if a “perfect unity” is an object such that, given any two nonsimultaneous events composing it, there is a possible causal process connecting the first of those two events with the second, then (i) is true.1 (In contemporary physics, ‹x precedes y› is defined as: ‹there is a possible causal process, e.g. a light-signal, beginning with x and ending with y.› ) On the other hand, if, by a “perfect unity,” one means an object such that, if x and y are any two of its parts, the very idea of x’s existing in the absence of y is an incoherent one, then (i) is meaningful—and false. (One can coherently imagine a universe in which Cheney exists but Biden does not.) In any case, the term “perfect unity” is clearly intended to refer to some sort of causal or logical integratedness, and once that mode of integration is pinpointed, (i) speedily becomes a true or false claim. “Statements” such as “the universe is a perfect unity,” “the nothing nothings,” and so on, aren’t really statements at all. They’re statement-forms. (i) is obviously supposed to attribute some property to the universe. But since this property isn’t identified, (i) contains an undefined term and therefore says nothing. Once that term is defined, a meaningful statement results. It’s true that (i) is neither tautologous nor confirmable. But that’s a consequence of the real problem, viz. that “perfect unity” is undefined. (i) is comparable to “x is tall.” The reason “x is tall” says nothing is that “x” is undefined—it hasn’t been assigned a referent. And...",

To see whether this is so, let’s consider Wittgenstein’s argument for it: At first sight a sentence—one set out on the printed page, for example—does not seem to be a picture of the reality with which it is concerned. But neither do written notes seem at first sight to be a picture of a piece of music, nor our phonetic notation (the alphabet) to be a picture of our speech. At yet these sign-languages prove to be pictures, even in the ordinary sense, of what they represent79 . . . There is a general rule by means of which the musician can obtain the symphony from the score, and which makes it possible to derive the symphony from the groove on the gramophone record, and, using the first rule, to drive the score again. That is what constitutes the inner similarity between these things which seem to be constructed in such entirely different ways. And that rule is the law of projection which projects the symphony into the language of musical notation. It is the rule for translating this language into the language of gramophone records. The idea seems to be that just as laws of projection coordinate the painting of the bowl of fruit with the bowl of fruit itself, so the semantic rules of a language coordinate its sentences with the realities they describe.80 But this analogy is a shallow one; and when it’s scrutinized, it becomes even more clear than before how unlike pictures sentences are. What if, because of some change in the environment, snow turned black? The English language would not for that reason be impaired. In fact, the English language would, without itself having to change, give us the resources to describe this change. We could describe it by saying “snow is black.” Thus, as far as the English language is concerned, snow can be any color. The semantic rules of English don’t say that snow is white. They say that, if snow is white, one can express that fact by saying “snow is white.” And those rules are to the effect that if snow is black, one can express that fact by saying “snow is black.” So the semantic rules of English assigns sentences not to the fact that snow is white—for as far those semantic rules know, it isn’t a...",

So isn’t by virtue of graphically representing the fact that people are sometimes happy that, when functioning as a sentence of L, D1 describes that fact.84 So far as D1 is a sentence of a language, what it actually picks out is irrelevant; the various nuances of the smiling gentleman’s face are irrelevant. In general, its internal structure is irrelevant. Considered as an expression of L, it has no internal structure. (It is what philosophers of language call a semantic primitive. A semantic primitive,” or primitive symbol,” is one that doesn’t consist of other symbols and that, so far as it is an expression of a language, thus has no internal structure.) For exactly similar reasons, each of the other photographs composing L is, when considered as an expression of L, devoid of internal structure and thus, in the most extreme way possible, not like a graphic representation. We must make one more point before we can close the argument. Let N be a photograph of a bolt of lightning, and suppose that N is the L-translation of the English expression “it is not the case that.” So if S is the L-translation of “grass is green,” NS is the L-translation of “grass is not green.” (NS is formed by putting N to the left of S.)

Nothing could physically resemble that operation, since it isn’t something that could possibly be seen or otherwise sense-perceived.

No proposition is identical with any image, since any image will contain information not contained in the image.

First of all, it’s hard to see how sense-perception, which gives us nothing but one image after another, could apprise us of truths that are incapable of being expressed in a strictly imagistic form. For argument’s sake, let’s concede to the empiricist that it’s strictly through perception that I know that the Moon is made of XYZ. How are we to deal with my subsequent knowledge that the Moon is not made of cheese? Obviously that knowledge is largely based on my knowledge that it’s made of XYZ.

So some kind of non-perceptual knowledge is involved in my making the leap from the moon is made of XYZ to the moon is not made of cheese. Here is a related, if not quite coincident, argument. Even if image-resistant facts (e.g., those expressed by negative statements) are learned in a strictly perceptual manner, the mental states that mediate our knowledge of them are not themselves images. The information borne by those mental states must be encoded in some non-iconic form. This means that, at some point, pictorial information was converted into non-pictorial information.

But, if correct, that point itself describes that relationship, calling into question its own coherence.91 In any case, contrary to what Wittgenstein says, we can identify the logical forms of our own utterances. To identify the logical form of a statement is simply to make it clear what it means. We can do this. We do it all the time. We do it whenever we put the meanings of words into words. There are some qualifications to this, as we’ll see in a moment, but none that redound to the credit of Wittgenstein’s point. Wittgenstein’s assertion that “what can be shown, cannot be said” is obviously false. I tell you that I can do fifty push-ups. (I say “I can do fifty push-ups.”) You don’t believe me. So I show you that I can do fifty push-ups. (I do fifty push-ups in front of you.) And, as we just saw, that principle holds no less in connection with logical forms than in connection with a person’s ability to do push-ups. Echoing what we said earlier, although it isn’t clear why Wittgenstein made these claims or what he meant by them, it is clear that they’re consistent with his view that sentences are pictures of reality. A picture cannot picture itself. If P is a picture of a seagull, P can’t contain a picture of itself, for the simple reason that nothing can be a proper part of itself. Of course, P might be a picture of a big seagull and also of some other, much littler, but otherwise identical seagull. But the big-seagull part of the picture isn’t identical with the little-seagull part. The big part contains two seagull-images; the little part only contains one. So if sentences were pictures, then a given sentence S1 couldn’t be a picture of itself. But it doesn’t follow that some other picture S2 couldn’t be a picture of S1. Nor, therefore, does Wittgenstein’s much stronger claim that nothing—no picture, no set of pictures, no sentence—could depict or otherwise represent the rules by which true statements are paired off with the facts they described. Wittgenstein’s claim that we cannot state the logical forms of sentences, which collapses into the brazenly false claim that we can never say what our words mean, has two...",

Every time one uses an English sentence to define an English expression, one is expressing a semantic rule of English in English. But neither the English language, nor any other, can state all of its own semantic rules. Here’s why. Given any meaningful expressions, there is a semantic rule r saying what s’s meaning is. (This is trivially true. A meaningful expression is one that has a meaning and is therefore one such that some true proposition identifies that meaning; and any proposition that, like r, says what an expression means is ipso facto a semantic rule.) So, for example, supposing that x is Dick Cheney, there is a semantic rule of English to the effect that “Dick Cheney” refers to x. That rule is not itself a sentence. But it can obviously be expressed by a sentence (as we just saw). In general, semantic rules, though often capable of being expressed by sentences, are not themselves sentences. In light of this fact, suppose for argument’s sake that, for each semantic rule of English, there is a sentence of English that expresses that rule. Let K be the class containing all and only sentences of English that correctly express actual semantic rules of English. Let SRE be the conjunction of all of K’s members. SRE is a true and therefore meaningful sentence of English. SRE is also a member of K. After all, K contains every sentence that correctly says what is meant by at least one expression of English, and SRE obviously satisfies that requirement. But given that SRE is also a conjunction consisting of all of K’s members, it follows that SRE is one of its own conjuncts. No conjunction can be one of its conjuncts. (The conjunction “snow is white and snow is white” is not one of its own conjuncts, since that sentence is a conjunction, whereas “snow is white” is not.) We’re forced to reject this obvious truth if we grant the supposition that the English language can express each of its own semantic rules. Therefore, the English language cannot state all of its own semantic rules. Given any language L, what we just said about English is true of L. Thus, no language can express all of its...",

    "text": "be logically perfect. Wittgenstein takes it for granted that the concept of such a language is a coherent one. Influenced by the TLP, many early analytic philosophers longed for the day when logically perfect languages would replace natural languages.95 In any case, the concept of a logically perfect language is not a coherent one. It isn’t possible for everything about a sentence’s meaning to be reflected in its grammar. And if per impossibile there did exist a logically perfect language, it would be expressively inferior to English, Arabic, and every other natural language. In other words, there would be much that couldn’t be said in it that could be said in any natural language. More precisely, for each analytic truth capable of being expressed by a logically perfect language, there would be infinitely many that it could not express and that English or Spanish or any other natural language could express. At the same time, there would be no truth that could be expressed in a logically perfectly language that couldn’t also be expressed in a logically imperfect language, such as English. Let us now discuss why this is so. A sentence belonging to a logically perfect language is analytically true iff it is formally true. Why is this? A sentence is perspicuous only to the extent that its grammatical form makes it clear what it says and, therefore, makes it clear what it entails and what entails it. Bearing this in mind, let S be some arbitrary sentence. To the extent that there are false sentences, or true but non-analytic sentences, that have the same surface-structure as S, S’s grammatical and logical forms don’t coalesce and, consequently, S isn’t perspicuous. So an analytically true sentence is perspicuous only if all other sentences having the same form are true. A sentence is formally true if, and only if, any sentence having the same form is true. Thus, a sentence is perspicuous only if formally true. Therefore, a sentence belonging to a logically perfect language is analytic only if formally true.96 A consequence is that, for each analytic truth that a logically perfect language can express, there are infinitely many that it cannot express. Given any object x and any property phi, the sentence",

    "text": "(S2) “given any object x and any property phi, x has phi, then x does not have phi” is not perspicuous, since it has the same surface structure as: (S3) “given no object x and no property phi, if x has phi, then x does not have phi,” which is false. Formally true sentences are instances of informally true universal generalizations. So no sentence capable of expressing such generalizations is logically perfect. This point has important and often overlooked consequences. Making a valid deductive inference involves recognizing an entailment. Your deductively inferring Q from P involves your recognizing that P entails Q. The only way to know that some formal entailment is valid is to know that some informal entailment is valid. You know that: (S4) “Jerry is in Richmond,” entails that (S5) “it’s not the case Jerry is not in Richmond” And that’s why, if you accept S4, you also accept S5. But how do you know that S4 entails S5? Is it on the basis of your knowledge that all instances of S1 are true?

One would think that (1)-(5) is correct. But this turned out not to be so. It turned out that (1)-(5) is a statement-form, not a statement proper, and that (1)-(5) therefore isn’t true or false. It also turned out that some of its instances are false. Let us now describe one such instance. Let S be some sphere. Given an arbitrary point on S’s surface, there is a path leading from that point back to that same point that cuts S into two symmetrical halves. If by a “line” we mean such a path, and we make the corresponding changes to the otherwise unchanged meanings of (1)-(4), the propositions thereby assigned to (1)-(4) are true, but the proposition assigned to (5) is false. For, if “space” and “line” are so defined, a line has zero parallels, as opposed to one. According to many, this shows that the parallel postulate isn’t true of every possible space. This isn’t what it shows. The parallel postulate isn’t true or false of anything. It’s a statement-form, not a statement, and statement-forms aren’t true or false of anything. The right conclusion to draw is that there are possible spaces that are (partly) described by sentences that are negations of instances of the parallel postulate. If “space” and “line” are defined in the conventional, Euclidean way, the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180.

This is an immediate consequence of the just-seen fact that, depending on what specific meanings are assigned to those words, (1)-(5) may come out either true or false. “But a ‘space’ isn’t the surface of a sphere,” one might protest. “And a ‘line’ isn’t a pathway of the sort just described. So all you’ve shown is that by misinterpreting (1)-(5), you can generate some interesting results. But that means that you haven’t really shown anything.” Not true. In saying that “space” and “line” don’t have these non-Euclidean meanings, one is making assumptions as to the nature of space that it is the very purpose of (1)-(5) to establish. In presupposing that ‹x is a space› entails that x isn’t the surface of a sphere, one is in effect presupposing that triangles have interior angles adding up to 180°—one is, indeed, presupposing a great many of the principles that (1)-(5) are supposed to establish. So one cannot, without invalidating one’s attempt to ground geometry in (1)-(5), assume that “line” and “space” are not to be defined in this way. In (1)-(5), the words “line” and “space” are functioning as variables, not as constants. We’ve seen that (1)-(5) isn’t true for all values of those variables. That is, some instances of that open-sentence are false. That is, that open-sentence isn’t true under all its interpretations. Formal logicians aspire to identify open-sentences that are true under all their interpretations, since it is only to the extent that they can do this that they can formalize analytic truth, which is their main objective. In the course of this search, they inevitably come across many open-sentences, such as (1)-(5), that they had hoped were true under all their interpretations but turned out not to be. Given an open-sentence S of this kind, they try to say, as precisely as possible, what it is that all those interpretations of S that validate it have in common with one another that they don’t have in common with any interpretation that fails to validate S. In other words, they try to come up with a general characterization of “truth under S.” There are some classes of true statements that one would expect to be formalizable but turn out not to be.

It will be seen that they coincide very nearly with those of Brentano and Meinong. In fairness to Salmon, whose important work I urge all aspiring philosophers to study, I should point out that my criticisms of his viewpoints are heavily biased by my conviction that philosophical problems ought to be adjudicated through use of post-Fregean methods. For this reason, those criticisms should be taken cum grano salis. And there’s no denying that Salmon’s views have a certain consonance with common sense. Many of my students say that truth is subjective—that everyone has their own truth. If that position is right, then Bart Simpson and Fred Flintstone do exist. Their sentiments, I would guess, are more in alignment with Salmon’s views than they are with mine. Salmon also holds that there exist non-existent objects. (See Salmon 2005, Chapters 1–3.) For example, he holds that the sentence “Socrates was wise” is meaningful and, therefore, that there exists something that is its meaning. But he also holds that this very meaning doesn’t exist. And Salmon holds that one can rationally believe a proposition and its negation—that, for example, one can, without being irrational, believe Smith is in Virginia and Smith is not in Virginia (since Smith is on the Moon) at the very same time. (See Salmon 2007, especially the chapter titled “Irrational belief.’) In Chapters 6, 8, and 9 we’ll discuss Salmon’s arguments for these views. But it’s a matter of secondary importance whether these positions of his are accurate. For should they turn out to be false, they would, for that very reason, be true! Remember what Salmon is arguing for: (i) the non-existent exists and (ii) it is sometimes rational believe P and not-P at the same time. The very fact of there being no good reasons to accept (i) would entail that there did exist good reasons to accept it; and the very fact of our having reason to reject (ii) would mean that, at least potentially, we had good reason to accept it. Thus, Salmon’s arguments, if unsuccessful, are successful for that very reason, and they are therefore self-validating. One can only marvel at such intellectual virtuosity.

This contention is false, Hempel rightly points out, given that it’s a very strong version of the view that only completely verifiable sentences are meaningful. The fact that this view is false shows that strict empiricism is false. Strict empiricism is the view that all non-trivial knowledge has a strictly sensory basis. To say that knowledge has a strictly sensory basis is to say that what is known is either (i) directly observed to be the case or (ii) is inferred from what is directly observed to be the case by means of an inference-rule of whose legitimacy one’s own observations made one aware.

If, in that proposition, Socrates must actually admire Plato, then the mere existence of that proposition predetermines its own truth. If it’s some other relationship that Socrates bears with respect to Plato, some other issue will be prejudged. In addition, the question will arise why it is that the proposition in question consists of Socrates’ bearing that relation to Plato. What is so special about that relationship? And to answer this question, Salmon would actually have to identify the relationship in question. To Salmon’s credit, he has attempted to identify this relationship. He has said that the proposition that Socrates admired Plato is the following ordered pair: <the relationship of admiring <Socrates, Plato>>. Thus, he has said, in effect, that the relationship in question—the one that Socrates bears to Plato in the proposition in question—is one that a thing x bears to a thing y in virtue of its being the case that the following ordered pair exists: <the relationship of admiring, <x, y>>. This is certainly very helpful. But we have a slight problem. Ordered pairs aren’t true or false. The ordered pair <the relationship of admiring <Socrates, Plato>> true or false.

According to this view, the meaning of: (K) JFK would have been reelected in 1964 if he hadn’t been assassinated is (K#) there is a possible world W where JKF was assassinated but where everything (prior to the date of this would-be assassination) is otherwise as much like our world as that fact permits; in W, JFK was reelected in 1964. And, according to this view: (S) If Smith, who is six-feet tall, were half his actual height, then he’d be three-feet tall means (S#) Given a world where Smith is half his current height, but is otherwise as much like our world as that fact permits, Smith is three-feet tall. This view was held by the late David Lewis (1941–2001).2 And it’s held, albeit in a veiled form, by contemporaries such as Boris Kment and Robert Stalnaker.3 I find this analysis completely preposterous. We don’t know anything about other universes, let alone whether Smith and Kennedy exist in them or, therefore, what their situations there are. Anything we do know about such universes is parasitic on our knowledge of counterfactual truths like K and S. (If per impossibile we were able to travel to other universes and we found that, in them, Smith was four-feet tall and Kennedy wasn’t reelected, we wouldn’t reevaluate K and S; we’d assume that we weren’t visiting worlds that were relevant to them, confirming our point that our knowledge of counterfactuals precedes our knowledge of other worlds.) The right analysis of counterfactuals, I would suggest, is to see them as grammatical variants of garden variety causal or logical statements. Thus, K and S mean, respectively: (K*) Kennedy’s assassination prevented an otherwise reelection bound Kennedy from being reelected and (S*) Anything that is half the height of something that is six-feet tall is three-feet tall.",

But intelligence itself is not in space-time. “But mightn’t the property of intelligence be nothing other than some sort of aggregate of all its instances?,” one might ask. “Mightn’t there be some way of spatio-temporalizing that entity?” No. Consider the property of having a perfectly triangular shape. Nothing has this property. Are we to say that it doesn’t exist? Were we to do so, we’d be saying that, since there are no instances of the property of triangularity, that property doesn’t exist. Which is the same as saying there exists a property, viz. that of triangularity, such that, because nothing has it, it doesn’t exist. Which is absurd. Also, a consequence of identifying properties with “aggregates” of their instances is that properties that clearly aren’t identical with each other must be seen as being identical with each other. (In this context, the word “aggregate” can refer to any spatiotemporal entity that is composed, in any sense of the word “compose,” of other spatiotemporal entities.) There are no perfectly spherical objects; nor, as we just pointed out, are there any perfectly triangular objects. So, if we identify properties with aggregates of their instances, the aggregate of all the instances of the one property is identical with the aggregate of all the instances of the other, the reason being that each aggregate is a perfect nullity. A story will clarify these points. Max is the world’s greatest harpsichord player. He’s also the only redhaired person who ever has, or ever will, set foot in house X. The property red-haired person who sets foot in X is co-extensive with the property world’s greatest harpsichord player. Given that, for this reason, there is no aggregate of things having either property, it follows that no aggregate of things having the one property is different in any respect from any aggregate having the other property. This means that, anything x that is an aggregate of the one kind will be identical with anything y that is an aggregate of the other. Thus, a consequence of identifying properties with aggregates of their instances is that there cannot be distinct, uninstantiated properties. But that’s absurd.

Everything just said about sets can be said of any entity that is constituted by property-instances. Suppose, for argument’s sake, that there is a “scattered object” consisting of all and only those human beings in existence. (This is a popular view among philosophers.5) Just replace each occurrence of “set” in the argument just given with “scattered object consisting of all and only human beings,” and the resulting argument shows that the property of being a person isn’t identical with that set. (Also, we’ll see in the next section that, setting aside properties that have only one instance, there are no spatiotemporal entities that can be identified with a given property’s instances. There are no “scattered objects.”) 2.0 Arguments against Platonism It is seldom denied that there are instances of properties, but it has often been denied that there are nonspatiotemporal entities. But it’s hard to see (i) how there could be instances of properties without there being properties themselves, and it is also hard to see (ii) how properties could be given spatiotemporal coordinates. Opponents of Platonism respond either by saying that (i) involves some sort of logical or linguistic trickery or by saying that properties can be identified with spatiotemporal entities. Let us now consider how anti-Platonists defend their view. 2.1. Argument #1 against Platonism Not every word in a sentence corresponds to some entity in the world. If I say “for the sake of all that is good, make sure you give at least some money to charity” the word “sake” doesn’t denote anything—there aren’t such things as sakes, after all—even though, being a noun, the word “sake” has the same syntactic function as words that do have denotations. We can develop this point by taking a brief tour through linguistic theory. It seems fairly clear that not all expressions refer to things.

And even though (at the microscopic level) the bag consists mostly of empty space, all of its parts occupy one, fairly compact, relatively continuous region of space-time. Now consider all the rocks in the universe. Those rocks clearly don’t constitute a dynamically or geographically integrated unit. Supposing that those rocks collectively constitute any object at all, the object they constitute is a “scattered object.” In general, a scattered object is one that lacks the cohesiveness and dynamic integrity of ordinary objects. According to some anti-Platonists, properties are scattered objects. Is this correct? No. There are no scattered objects. The very concept of such a thing is an incoherent one. In Chapter 16, we’ll see why. Here’s an outline of what we said. If spatially disjoint entities are to constitute a single spatiotemporal object, their interactions must be characterized by a certain regularity and predictability. Since it cannot be known without doing empirical research whether the various rocks in the world have this property, it cannot be said whether there is some “scattered object” consisting of all the rocks in existence. But even if scattered objects do exist, properties aren’t identical with them. Let R be some scattered object composed of all the rocks in the universe.

How is this to be explained? Even though the even numbers are a subset of the whole numbers, it is possible to put the two sets of numbers into a one-one8 correspondence. Since, whenever two sets can be put into such a correspondence they have the same number of members, it follows that the set of even numbers has as many members as the set of whole numbers.9 This explanation is not causal. It explains a truth not by identifying its causal antecedents, but by delineating the structures of concepts. Many explanations are like this. You ask me: “Why can’t someone know something without having any form of awareness?” I answer (correctly) by saying: “because knowing something involves having a true belief, and a belief is a form of awareness.” This explanation identifies conditions that are conceptually, not causally, necessary conditions for knowledge. Like this explanation, Plato’s theory isn’t a causal theory, and it’s therefore irrelevant that properties aren’t in space-time.",

    "text": "“snow” “snow” “snow” Is it one or three? The answer: there are three instances of one word. To put it another way, there are three s tokens of one word-type.16 Instances of an expression are called expression-tokens and the expressions themselves are called expression-types. No one utterance of the word “snow” is identical with that word. It’s not as though the word-type “snow” will disappear when the inscriptions of it in the line above this one is destroyed. That word-type is a property of certain deposits of ink (e.g., the ones above) and burst of noise, and those ink-deposits and bursts of noise are therefore instances of that property. This shows that, even if the nominalist is right to replace identify the property of being a rock with the word “rock,” he has still conceded the truth of Platonism. Plus, that property isn’t identical with that word. The Spanish word for rock is “piedra.” It would be arbitrary to identify that property with the word “rock” but not with the word “piedra.” Since “rock” and “piedra” are obviously different words, the nominalist must say that the property of being a rock is not identical with itself, which is absurd. All of these points aside, it makes no sense to identify that property, or any other, with a word. A thing’s being a rock has nothing to do with words; there were rocks before there were words.",

It’s simply a way something would have to be in order to be a piece of meat in X that passed inspection. The same is true of the property of being a pink elephant. There are no instances of that property, since there are no pink elephants. But there is a way that something would have to be to be a pink elephant. I know what that way is, and so do you. That’s why we both know that, by going to the zoo and spray-painting one of the elephants there, we could make something be that way; and that’s why we also know that nothing is that way (or, in any case, that nothing we’ve ever heard of is that way—maybe some prankster spray painted an elephant). For something to “instantiate the property of being a pink elephant” is simply for it to be that way. So that property isn’t some pink elephant in the sky. It’s just a way something would have to be to be a pink elephant. And for there to be no instances of that property is simply for nothing to be that way. Properties can be thought of as conditions. The property of being a pink elephant is a condition a thing must fulfill in order to be a pink elephant. Lots of unfulfilled conditions exist. Mary won’t marry someone unless he fulfills the following condition: he’s a genius who is always friendly and never sleeps and always dotes on her and has a billion dollars. That condition isn’t fulfilled by anyone. But the condition exists. Thus, properties that aren’t instantiated are just unfulfilled conditions. So given that there are unfulfilled conditions, it follows that there are uninstantiated properties. And given that properties exist, even when they have no instances, it follows that, when they do exist, they aren’t identical with their instances. The property of being a pink elephant exists, but is currently uninstantiated. If there were to come into being a single pink elephant, which promptly died, the property wouldn’t go out of existence. It would still be around. But if it were identical with instances, then it would go out of existence the moment its one instance did.",

Sets are non-spatiotemporal entities. Given that sets are really properties, it follows that, given only that sets are non-spatiotemporal, it doesn’t follow that anything non-spatiotemporal isn’t a property. Propositions are non-spatiotemporal entities. But they two are properties. The proposition JM is playing tennis at time t is true just in case certain properties are instantiated at certain times, and we may therefore identify that proposition with the set containing the relevant properties and identify that proposition’s being true with the fact of all of that set’s members’ being instantiated. We’ll work out the details in the next chapter. Since sets can, in the way just described, be identified with properties, it follows that propositions are properties. Properties aren’t mind-independent and neither (therefore) are propositions. But, of course, it’s a popular belief, mainly among empiricists, that propositions, if existent, are human creations. Here is a reason, distinct from the one just given, to think otherwise. There are infinitely many propositions. (Since there are infinitely many locations, there are, for any given particle x, infinitely propositions of the form x is in place y at time t.)We couldn’t therefore have directly created every proposition there is. So, supposing that propositions are human creations, we must be only indirectly responsible for infinity many of them, and it must therefore be supposed that we created some finite stock of propositions that somehow brought about the rest. But in that case there are true propositions, which we’ll refer to as “intermediary” propositions, that describe how the ones we directly created brought about the others. But since there are infinitely many propositions that we didn’t create, there are infinitely many intermediary propositions: one for each proposition not directly created. (Suppose for argument’s sake that we didn’t directly create the proposition that dinosaurs wore tweed, and also suppose that p1...pn are the propositions that we directly created. In that case, there is a true intermediary proposition to the effect that p1...pn brought about the propositions that dinosaurs wear tweed, another intermediary proposition...",

Once again, let S be a set that contains all and only A, B, and C2; and remember that we have identified S with 1 (the proposition that Tommy is smoking). First of all, if C is instantiated, so are B and A. Further, if C, and therefore B and A, are instantiated, then, and only then, is 1 true. It follows that 1 is true if and only if each of A, B, and C is instantiated. This is consistent with, and even corroborates, the thesis that 1 is S and that 1’s being true is S’s members being jointly instantiated. Of course, that does not by itself show that 1 can be identified with S or that 1’s being true can be identified with S’s members being jointly instantiated. After all, there are infinitely many distinct sets of properties such that 1 is true just in case their members are instantiated. For example, let Z be the set containing the following properties and nothing besides: the property of being identical with a smoking Tommy; the property of being an even number; the property of being three sided if a triangle. The second two properties are instantiated in every possible world, given that even numbers necessarily exist and given that triangles cannot fail to have three sides. But surely Z cannot be identified with 1, the reason being that Z’s membership cannot, at least not in a sufficiently natural manner, be aligned with what we know about 1’s constituency. But S’s membership does so align, as a brief look back makes clear. S’s members are (or at least include) A, B, and C. 1’s constituents are (or at least include):",

That property is instantiated exactly if A and B are both instantiated. So, in a very clear sense of the term “combine,” that property combines the property of smoking with (something individuative of) Tommy. (In the relevant sense of the term “combine,” one property “combines” n other properties exactly if the first is instantiated exactly if the other n properties are jointly instantiated.) And we know that, in some way or other, 1 combines (something individuative of) Tommy with the property of smoking.

Moreover, C “dominates” each of A and B in a way suggestively similar to the way in which 1 dominates its constituents. A’s being instantiated is necessary but not sufficient for C’s being instantiated, the same being true of B’s being instantiated. Tommy’s existing is necessary but not sufficient for 1’s being true, the same being true of somebody’s being a smoker. While none of this demonstrates definitively that 1 is identical with S or that 1’s being true is identical with S’s being instantiated, we have, I believe, found enough of a match between 1/1’s being true and S/S’s members’ being instantiated to warrant looking into the idea that they might be one and the same.",

So PWS cannot, without arbitrariness, take an intensionalist view of functions; but it cannot, without failing to distinguish between obviously distinct propositions, take an extensionalist view of them either. 6.2.1 A similar problem Consider the proposition grass is green. As we know, PWS identifies that proposition with a function (that assigns truth to worlds where grass is green) or with a set of worlds (containing all and only those worlds where grass is green). If it isn’t thought of as a set of ordered pairs, that function must be thought of as a rule of some kind. What kind of rule?

Given that, as we saw, (2)’s having P2 for its meaning isn’t identical with P2’s being what people mean in uttering (2), it follows that (1)’s having P1 for its meaning isn’t identical with P1’s being what people mean in uttering (1). Of course, what we just said about (1) and (2) can be said of any other sentence. So even if what people mean in uttering a given sentence happens to coincide with its literal meaning, what it is for sentence S to have proposition P for its literal meaning isn’t for people to mean P in uttering S. Psychological meaning presupposes linguistic meaning. What a person means when uttering a given sentence is a function of, among other things, his beliefs as to what that sentence already means. You must believe that “snow is white” means snow is white if, intending to speak sincerely and literally, you say “snow is white” with the intention of getting it across that snow is white. If you think that “snow is white” means grass is green, you cannot, if your intention is to speak sincerely and literally, believe that “snow is white” means snow is white. Of course, you could know full well what “snow is white” in fact means, but use that sentence to get across something that has nothing to do with the color of snow. Knowing what “snow is white” actually means, you might utter that sentence with the intention of getting it across that the government is controlling our thoughts with alpha waves. And, depending on the circumstances, that could be precisely what an utterance of that sentence would convey. But whatever the message is that, in...",

Neo-Griceans hold that, even though literal meaning cannot in all cases be identified with speaker’s meaning, it is always, ultimately, to be understood in terms of it. Wittgenstein (1958) advocated a version of this view. “Roughly speaking,” he said, “meaning is use.” Expressions mean what we use them to mean—they mean what we mean by them. Wittgenstein nowhere makes it clear what he means by the words “roughly speaking.” But it doesn’t matter, since his statement isn’t even roughly true. Literal meaning is isn’t identical with speaker’s meaning and isn’t to be understood in terms of it. It’s the other way around. We saw why in Section 1.3. Also, Grice’s theory fails to deal with the fact that the meaning of a subsentential expression isn’t something that could be possibly be meant. “Of ” has a meaning; so does “skip,” “snorkel,” “or,” “gladly,” etc. But whatever it is that “or” means, it cannot, at least not by itself, be what a person means.

But this isn’t correct as we just saw. CRS is incoherent for reasons other than the one just given. According to that doctrine, what a sentence means is determined by what people infer from it and what people infer it from. Whereas commonsense holds that one infers “an even number is less five” from “two is less than five” because the latter already has a given meaning, advocates of CRS say that, on the contrary, it’s because people infer “an even number is less than five” and other similar statements from “two is less than five” that the latter has the meaning it has. This is not a viable view. If we learn tomorrow that, contrary to what we previously thought, Aristotle wrote several plays, we’ll infer “somebody who wrote several plays wrote the Nichomachean Ethics“ from “Aristotle wrote the Nichomachean Ethics.” But it doesn’t follow that “Aristotle wrote the Nichomachean Ethics” would have undergone some change in its semantic meaning. Changes in what we believe affect what we infer from statements; but they don’t categorically change the meanings of those statements. CRS entails that every inference is an analytic inference. Once it’s learned that Aristotle wrote plays, it becomes, according to CRS, constitutive of the meaning of “Aristotle wrote the Nichomachean Ethics” that one can infer from it that a playwright wrote the Nichomachean Ethics. But surely the inference from “Aristotle wrote the Nichomachean Ethics” to “a playwright wrote the Nichomachean Ethics” isn’t analytic.13 What we may infer from a sentence is answerable to its existing meaning. CRS says that a sentence’s meaning is answerable to what we infer from it. If correct, that would have the consequence that one couldn’t possibly draw a false inference from any sentence. Which, in its turn, would have the consequence that no sentence would mean anything. Which, since nothing meaningless is a sentence, would have the absurd consequence that there neither are, nor could be, sentences. Consider the sentence “Bill plagiarized his first novel.” If one knows that sentence to be true, one can make inferences about Bill’s character, his past activities, his ambitions, his values, and so on, that one couldn’t make...",

And the rule in question is clearly this: “If, at time t, person p tokens the sentencetype “I am tired,” then the proposition thereby affirmed is true exactly if p is tired at p.” The same thing mutatis mutandis is true of all context-sensitive expressions. So the rule that assigns a proposition to an utterance of “that man is married to that woman” is: if, in the context of utterance, x is a uniquely salient man and y is a uniquely salient woman, a token of the sentence-type “that man is married to that woman” affirms a proposition that is true if and only if x is married to y. So context-sensitive sentence-types aren’t true or false; they don’t, in and of themselves, bear propositions. But they have an important semantic role: the identity of the proposition meant by a token of such a type depends on the identity of the type. A token of “I am tired” means one thing; a token of “you are tired,” uttered by the same person at the same time, means something else; and that difference obviously stems from the fact that, because different sentence-types were tokened, the semantic rule that assigns a proposition to the one token is different from the rule that assigns a proposition to the other. This can all be distilled into the following principle: where context-sensitive sentences are concerned, the meaning of a token is a proposition, and the meaning of type is a rule that assigns a proposition to one of its tokens on the basis of facts about the context in which that token occurred. Long story short: the meanings of sentence-tokens are propositions and the meanings of sentence-types are rules that assign propositions to their tokens, usually on the basis of facts about the context of tokening.",

    "text": "But IA’s context-insensitivity, we must conclude, is a thoroughly pragmatics-based affair. Obvious extensions of this reasoning show that all expression-types have rules that assign meanings (or referents) to their tokens and, therefore, that where any expression is concerned, type-meaning diverges from token-meaning. The meaning of the expression-type “that man” is: a token of “that man,” uttered in context C, refers to x if, in C, x is uniquely a salient man. If, in a given context, Smith is such a man, then a token in that context of “that man” refers to Smith; if instead Jones is such a man, it refers to Jones; etc. The same is true of “the current President.” In one context (the year 1992), tokens of that expression refer to Bill Clinton; in a different context (the year 2009) it refers to Barack Obama. Some would be tempted to say that, because they have fixed referents, proper names (e.g., “Bill Clinton”) don’t have a two-dimensional semantic structure. This would be a mistake. Expression-tokens are physical entities—bursts of noise, deposits of ink, etc. Expression-tokens are therefore perceptible entities and are thus capable of transmitting information. Expression-types, on the other hand, are abstract entities and are thus inherently unsuited to be vehicles of communication. Let us develop these points. Expression-types are properties. Why are they properties? Tokens of a type are instances of it. Anything of which there are instances is ipso facto a property. So expression-types, unlike expression-tokens, are properties and are therefore non-spatiotemporal entities. And, as we just noted, it makes no sense to suppose a nonspatiotemporal entity could mediate information or, therefore, could in any significant sense be a symbol. Also, given the profound metaphysical differences between tokens and types, it would be theoretical arbitrariness of the worst kind to suppose that types could discharge the same semantic functions as their tokens. We must therefore assume that, whereas tokens of “Bill Clinton” refer to Bill Clinton, the corresponding type does not refer to Bill Clinton; and we must also assume that “Bill Clinton,” the expression-type, has for its meaning a (constant) function that assigns Bill Clinton to any given one of its tokens. In general, proper names, no less than indexicals and definite descriptions have two-dimensional semantics. The semantic rule corresponding to a proper name is a constant function, whereas the semantic rule corresponding to an indexical or definite description is not a constant...",

Since there is some object x (namely, Socrates) such that ‘Socrates is tall’ says that x is tall, and since ‹x is tall› has the same form as “Socrates is tall,” the fact that “Socrates” is to be defined contextually does not entail that logical and grammatical form ever diverge. So it is only because certain expressions are to be defined contextually that such divergences occur. But which expressions? Those that cannot also be defined denotatively. Whenever an expression can be defined denotatively, a sentence’s logical form will not, by virtue of that sentence’s containing that expression, diverge from its logical form. (But, of course, that sentence’s logical form may diverge from its logical form for some other reason. Thus, the logical form of “Socrates saw someone” diverges from its grammatical form; but the reason for this is that it contains the word “someone.” The occurrence of “Socrates” in that sentence isn’t what induces that divergence.) Let E be an arbitrary expression that can be defined denotatively. In other words, suppose there to be some object x such that E is defined by saying that it refers to x. The logical form of ‹E has psi› is: x has psi. In general, to the extent that the logical form a sentence containing E is determined by its containing that expression, that sentence’s logical and grammatical forms coincide.

But even if I were more visually adept and, for that reason, could produce more exact visual surrogates for the concepts I’m thinking about, my ratiocinative activity couldn’t possibly be identical with any sequence of images. For any given sequence of images, a creature that could experience those images wouldn’t necessarily have any of the concepts that they represent in my thought processes.

For reasons that we’ll discuss in the next section, he inferred that thinking consists of engaging in overt behaviors that involve symbols belonging to some public language.7 Wittgenstein’s position is rank absurdity. He’s right, of course, that tickles, itches, etc., aren’t thoughts.8 But what follows isn’t that thoughts aren’t mental entities. What follows is that thoughts, unlike itches and tickles, aren’t phenomenologically pregnant.

David Hume argues that there is nothing to one’s mind other than the conscious events that populate it.9 His argument is that, when introspects, he only encounters various tickles, pains, and other sensations. This argument assumes that everything there is to know about one’s mind is to be known in the same quasi-perceptual, phenomenology-drenched way in which we know of our sensations. But this assumption is blatantly false. I know that I believe that 2 + 2 = 4, and I know it in a relatively direct way.

People fail to see the consequences of the principles they grasp. In fact, since any given proposition has infinitely many consequences, people fail to grasp infinitely many consequences of anything that they grasp. But to the extent that one’s grasp of a given principle is determinative of what one knows, there isn’t a gap between grasping meaning, on the one hand, and applying it, on the other. And to the extent that one doesn’t see the consequences of some meaning or principle that one grasps, it isn’t because one has failed to interpret it. A story will clarify these points. Brown is a highly (but not superhumanly) intelligent person who not only speaks perfect English, but is exceptionally (but, again, not superhumanly) adept at understanding highly intricate sentences. XYZ is a sentence of English that is 100,000 words long but is otherwise normal. XYZ is grammatical, coherent, etc.20 Even though Brown knows the relevant semantic rules, he obviously can’t understand XYZ.

In and of itself, that semantic knowledge is good to go. But, under the circumstances, it’s weighed down by limitations on Brown’s part that have nothing at all to do with his semantic competence. Brown’s memory isn’t perfect; he can’t keep too many tasks going in his mind simultaneously, even if any given one of them is elementary. These aren’t semantic limitations on Brown’s part.

That same day, Smith sees some poisonous berries on the dark side of the hill, and writes X35 down in his notebook. (Let “X35” be our symbol for that particular inscription.) On Tuesday, he reads what he wrote down. Question: is there any way that Smith can misinterpret what he’s written? If he takes “X35” to mean that the sun is out, his interpretation of “X35” will be inconsistent with his Monday intentions. But so what? Since Smith is the only person who speaks Smithese1. So the expressions belonging to it mean whatever he thinks they mean. An English-speaker can’t just decide that “snow is white” means that grass is green, since it is the thoughts (and practices) of people in general, and not of this or that specific person, that decides what is meant by “snow is white.” But in this context, Smith is “people in general.” So his believing that “X35” means that the sun is out is like everybody’s deciding that “snow is white” means that grass is green. And just as “snow is white” would mean that if everybody thought it did, so X35 means that the sun is out because, in effect, everybody thinks it does, the reason being that, in this context, Smith is everybody. Thus, the expressions of Smithese1 mean whatever Smith thinks they mean. This means that he can’t be wrong as to what they mean. But a symbol that can’t be used wrongly doesn’t mean anything. What makes utterances of “John is a soccer player” meaningful is that they are used wrongly if John isn’t a soccer player.

For any property phi, “Benjamin Franklin” refers to BF (and not to Aristotle, for example) because ‹Benjamin Franklin has phi› attributes phi to Benjamin Franklin; and if one couldn’t attribute phi to Benjamin Franklin by saying ‹Benjamin Franklin has phi› then “Benjamin Franklin” would not refer to BF. Further, if, in uttering that sentence, one was attributing baldness to Aristotle (but not BF), then “Benjamin Franklin” would refer to Aristotle (but not Benjamin Franklin).Thus, for “Benjamin Franklin” to refer to BF it is both necessary and sufficient that ‹Benjamin Franklin has phi› attribute phi to BF. The fact that “Benjamin Franklin” refers to BF is identical with the fact that ‹Benjamin Franklin has phi› attributes phi to Benjamin Franklin, for any property phi. In general, expression E refers to O if and only if for any property phi ‹E has phi› attributes phi to O. E’s referring to O may be identified with E’s being such that, in virtue of containing it, a sentence ipso facto attributes a property to O. In light of these points, let us look at an age-old puzzle that Russell neatly solved. Benjamin Franklin (BF) invented bifocals and he was also the first postmaster general. Therefore: (CB) the inventor of bifocals is identical with the first postmaster general. It’s also true, of course, that: (TB) the inventor of bifocals is identical with the inventor of bifocals. But, whereas TB is trivial, CB is non-trivial. The non-triviality of CB is hard to explain if definite descriptions are supposed to be referring terms. As we just saw, “the inventors of bifocals” refers to BF exactly if “Benjamin Franklin has phi” attributes phi to BF. Given that “the inventors of bifocals” does in fact refer to BF, it follows that CB attributes the property of being identical with the first postmaster general to BF. And given that “the first postmaster general” refers to BF, it follows that CB attributes the property of being identical with the inventor of bifocals to BF. And given both of these facts (viz. the facts stated in the last two sentences), it follows that CB says of BF that it has the property of being identical with BF. Which is trivial. Frege proposed a famous solution to this. But we’re going to consider Russell’s solution first, since it’s easier to understand Frege’s solution in terms of Russell’s than vice...",

    "text": "Analogues of these points hold with respect to “the first postmaster general.” There is its referent (which is BF); and there is its sense (which is the property of being a unique first postmaster general). The reason that TB is non-trivial is that, although the definite descriptions in it have the same referent, they have different senses. A comparison may help. Imagine that you’re looking at a certain person in the distance. That person is in fact Ralph, but you don’t know it, because he’s so far away and also, let us suppose, because he is (for reasons that aren’t important) wearing a suit of armor. You see that he is doing jumping jacks. Later Ralph is standing right in front of you and, of course, you see him. He’s wearing a plaid shirt. Once again, he’s doing jumping jacks. The first visual perception has the same object as the second. And each of those perceptions says of that object he or she is doing jumping jacks. But those two perceptions pick out that object in different ways. In the first case, that object is presented to you as something that has one set of properties (it’s far away, wearing a suit of armor, etc.); in the other case it’s presented as having a different set of properties (it’s nearby, is wearing a plaid shirt, etc.). And that’s why, even though those perceptions have the same object, and even though both attribute the property of doing jumping jacks to that object, those perceptions tell you different things. The relationship between “the inventors of bifocals” and “the first postmaster general” is to be understood along similar lines. They have the same object (referent); but they pick that thing out through different bodies of information. That’s why ‹the inventors of bifocals has phi› and ‹the first postmaster general has phi› tell you different things, even though they attribute the same property (phi) to the same object (BF).6",

It goes without saying that, if there is no unique inventor of bifocals, then there is no way that IB can be true. (Frege himself emphasizes this last point. And he’s right. There’s no way that “the elephant in the corner is eating peanuts” can be true if there’s no elephant in the corner.) The upshot is that IB is true if and only if: (IB*) something uniquely invented befocals, and any such thing is tall. But what does the Theory of Discriptions (TD) say about IB? According to TD, the meaning of IB is: IB*. So Frege’s theory collapses into Russell’s. By obvious extensions of this, it follows that, if Frege’s theory is right, then CB’s meaning is identical with that of CBR. So Frege’s theory accounts for the non-triviality of CB in the same way as Russell’s theory (as TD).",

For the time being, let’s suppose with Frege that definite descriptions are referring terms. In that case, the definite description in 1 co-refers with the definite description in 4. They both refer to BF. 1 says of BF that he has the property of being believed by Smith to be 6-feet tall; and 4 says of BF that he has the property of being believed by Smith to not be 6-feet tall.

This means that, if E and E* co-refer, and S is a sentence containing E, then replacing E with E* will result in a sentence that is true if S is true and false if S is false. (It’s assumed that the expressions being inter-substituted belong to the same language, are inflected in the same way, etc.) “Cicero was a Roman orator” is true; and so, therefore, is “Tully was a Roman orator,” given that “Tully” co-refers with “Cicero.” “Cicero was a 19th-century logician” is false; and so, therefore, is “Tully was a 19th-century logician.” Another way of stating this principle is that “inter-substituting co-referring terms preserves truth-value.” The original sentence (“there is water in my glass”) is true (false) iff the new sentence (“there is H2O in my glass”) is true (false). Supposing, as Frege does, that “the inventor of bifocals” and “the first postmaster general” are referring terms, then, given that those expressions co-refer, replacing the one with the other should preserve truth-value. But it doesn’t. 1 may be false if 3 is true and vice versa. TD solves this problem. According to TD, the meanings of 1–4 are, respectively: (1R) “Smith believes that something uniquely invented bifocals, and any such thing is 6 ft tall.” (2R) “Smith believes that something uniquely invented bifocals, and any such thing is not 6 ft tall.” (3R) “Smith believes that something was a unique first postmaster general and any such thing is 6 ft tall.” (4R) “Smith believes that something was a unique first postmaster general and any such thing is not 6 ft tall.” 1 doesn’t entail 3, and 1 is compatible with 4. 2 doesn’t entail 4 and 2 is compatible with 3. (This is the hard data.) 1R doesn’t entail 3R, and 1R is compatible with 4R. 2R doesn’t entail 4R and 2R is compatible with 3R. So TD is compatible with the hard-data, whereas Frege’s theory is not.

According to Frege, 2 is what results when a referring term in 1 is replaced with a co-referring term, and 4 is what results when a referring term in 3 is replaced with a co-referring term. But this isn’t what is going on. What (1) really says is that: (1*) Smith wants it to be the case that Smith is married to a woman who is prettier than any other.

(1*) and (2*) thus make it clear what (1) and (2), respectively, are actually saying. In other words, (1*) and (2*) expose the logical forms of (1) and (2). Notice that, in (1), the grammatical object is an expression referring to a person (“the prettiest woman on Earth”), whereas in (1*) the grammatical object (the italicized part) is an expression referring to a proposition. And in (2), the grammatical object is an expression referring to a person (“the most evil person on the planet”), whereas in (2*) the grammatical object (the italicized part) is an expression referring to a proposition.

Similarly, (2*) makes it clear that, if (2) is true, the object of Smith’s desire is not a person, but a proposition, namely, that Smith is married to somebody who is more evil than anyone else. Since those two propositions are different, the fact that one of them has the property of being desired to be true by Smith, whereas the other does not lack that property, does not constitute a violation of Leibniz’s Law.

The italicized expression in A refers to one proposition; its counterpart in B refers to a different proposition. (We’ll refer to the italicized expressions in A and B, respectively, as A* and B*). But B* is what results when a referring term is replaced with a co-referring term. According to the principle of special compositionality (PSC), A* and B* should co-refer. PSC says that what an expression refers to depends on what its parts refer to. “Mary’s favorite person” refers to Smith, whereas “Billy’s favorite person” refers to Jones. Why the difference in reference? Because “Mary” and “Billy” don’t co-refer, and what a given expression refers to affects what expressions containing it refer to. For the same reason mutatis mutandis, if “Crusher” is Mary’s nickname, and thus co-refers with “Mary,” “Crusher’s favorite person” co-refers with “Mary’s favorite person.” PSC is the obviously correct semantic corollary of the obviously correct principle that replacing equals with equals results in equals. But Frege’s semantics violates PSC. According to it, B* is what results when a referring term in A* is replaced with a co-referring term, and yet A* and B* don’t co-refer. Russell’s system doesn’t have this problem. Russell said, correctly, that A* and B* are contractions of, respectively: (A#) “some smart person single-handedly invented bifocals” and (B#) “some smart person post-master general before anyone else.” It didn’t even occur to Frege to take anything at all like Russell’s position. To compatibilize his system with PSC, Frege said that, when expressions occur in intensional contexts, they undergo reference-shifts. According to Frege, “the inventor of bifocals” ordinarily refers to Benjamin Franklin (BF); in other words, its so refers when it occurs in extensional contexts. But when it falls within the scope of one intensionality-inducing operator, it refers to the sense of “the inventor of bifocals.” (An intensionality-inducing is what most other authos refer to as a “non-extensional connective.” It is an operator having the property that any sentences or open-sentences falling within its scope are substitution-intolerant.) “Fred believes” is such an operator. Given that he insists on seeing definite descriptions as sense-bearing referring terms, Frege has no choice but to take this desperate measure: if he doesn’t, his system violates PSC, in which case it’s false, since PSC is true. Thus, if Frege’s system is right, then the occurrence of “the inventor of...",

In addition to being radically counterintuitive, Frege’s position is logically and methodologically indefensible (or so I argue in Kuczynski (2007) and other places). 4.0 The theory of descriptions revisited: the wide-scope/narrow-scope distinction10 Let us refer to sentences containing definite descriptions as “D-sentences.” So a D-sentence is any sentence of the form ‹...the phi...› There is a certain sub-class of D-sentences that are systematically ambiguous. One of the virtues of the theory of descriptions is that it, unlike its Fregean competitor, accounts for the fact that these sentences are ambiguous and it also accounts for the exact way in which they are ambiguous. In this context, it will be helpful to remember that an open sentence is an expression that contains a free variable, and is therefore neither true nor false, but is otherwise just like a sentence. So ‹x is a human being› is an open-sentence; so is ‹x is even. › These open sentences are “true for” some values of their free variables. (The first is true for “Socrates,” “Plato,” etc. The second is true for “2,” “4,” etc.) But it must be emphasized that an open sentence is not itself true or false. (In this context, the word “sentence” will be short for “sentences or open sentences.”) An expression (or class of expressions11) is said to satisfy an open sentence if a true sentence results when that expression replaces the free variables in that sentence. Thus, “two” satisfies the open sentence “x is an even number,” whereas “Mr. T” does not satisfy it, and neither does “three.” 4.1 Scope, operators, and syntactic ambiguity The semantics of these sentences is to be understood in terms of the concept of scope. Scope is a property of operators—that is, of expressions that, given sentences or open-sentences, form new sentences. So “John believes that” is an operator, since, when joined with “grass is green,” it yields the sentence “John believes that grass is green.” All quantifiers are operators. Examples of quantifiers are “all humans,” “some triangles,” “most dolphins.” So are their counterparts in formalized extensions of English (e.g., “given any human being x,” “for some triangle y,” etc.). Why is “all humans” a quantifier? First of all,...",

This is Nathan Salmon’s (2005) position. Salmon qualifies his position by saying that the fountain of youth, though existent, is a “mythical” object. But, since mythical objects don’t gush water, let alone immortality-giving water, Jerry won’t consider his search to have to an end when he discoveries the non-entity that Salmon describes. Given Russell’s insight, there’s no need to accept Salmon’s rather doubtful position. Because of his failure to grasp the implications of the wide-scope/narrow-scope distinction, another well known 20th century philosopher, W.V.O Quine (1908–2000), advocated the highly implausible view that “necessary,” “possible,” and modal terms in general, have no coherent meanings and that statements such as “it’s possible that there will be rain” and “it’s a necessary truth that triangles have three sides” are either false or meaningless.14 Here is his argument.15 For argument’s sake, suppose that the concepts expressed by “necessary” and “possible” are meaningful. In that case: (FB) “it’s a necessary truth that the inventor of bifocals was the inventor of bifocals” expresses a truth, even though (BF) “it’s a necessary truth that the inventor of bifocals was the first postmaster general” expresses a falsehood. Given the truth of FB, says Quine, it follows that the inventor of bifocals necessarily has the property of being identical with the inventor of bifocals. It follows by Leibniz’s Law16 that the first postmaster general also has the property. But if he did, then BF would be true, which it is not. With one exception, all of our assumptions were clearly correct. Leibniz’s Law holds, and FB is a necessary truth if ever there was one. Since the only remaining assumption is that “necessary” and “possible” express coherent concepts, that assumption is wrong. It follows that all statements to the effect that something is possible or necessary or impossible (etc.) are either meaningless or false.",

Let “~” mean “it is not the case that.” Let “(x)” mean “given any object x.” And, as before, we’ll use parentheses to indicate how sentences are to be grouped together. So “Smith is tall and (grass is green or birds fly)” says that it’s the case both that grass is green or birds fly and that Smith is tall. By contrast, “(Smith is tall and grass is green) or birds fly” makes the very different statement that either it’s the case that Smith is tall and grass is green or it’s the case that birds fly. Bearing these points in mind, consider the following argument: Argument #1 Premise: No mammal is intelligent if it has pointy ears. Premise: Smith is a pointy-eared mammal. Conclusion: Smith isn’t intelligent. This argument is valid. But, thus expressed, it isn’t formally valid. This is because “no mammal is intelligent if it has pointy ears” has the same syntax as “Jones is intelligent if he has pointy ears,” a consequence being that Argument #1 has the same syntactical form as the following, clearly invalid argument: Argument #2 Premise #1: Jones is intelligent if he has pointy ears. Premise #2: Smith is a pointy-eared mammal. Conclusion: Smith isn’t intelligent. But by reparsing the sentences occurring in these arguments, Frege showed why it is that, their surface-structures notwithstanding, Argument #1 is valid whereas Argument #2 is not. It will help if we make it clear at an intuitive level what the premises in Argument #1 are saying. The first premise is to the effect that anything that is an intelligent mammal does not have pointy ears. (In other words, given any object x, if x is an intelligent mammal, then x doesn’t have pointy ears. To put it yet another way, given anything x, if x is a mammal, then, if x is intelligent, it follows that x doesn’t have pointy ears.) The second premise is to the effect that Smith is a mammal and Smith has pointy ears. Finally, the conclusion is to the effect that it’s not the case that Smith is intelligent.

(It’s assumed that the replacements are uniform—i.e., that you don’t, for example, assign “intelligent” to one occurrence of “F” and “tall” to some other occurrence of it.) For example, replace F, G, and H, respectively, with “prime,” “even,” and “greater than 3”; and replace A with “7.” The resulting argument is: Argument #1AA7: Premise #1: (x)(x is prime→((x is even)→~(x is greater than three)). Premise #2: 7 is prime and 7 is greater than three. Conclusion: ~(7 is even). This argument is clearly valid. The only even prime is 2. So no even prime is greater than three. Given that 7 is prime and greater than three, it follows that 7 isn’t even. The result of uniformly replacing the variables in Argument #1G with constants always yields a valid argument.

We may thus identify the number two with the property of being a pair of objects (i.e., with the property had by all and only pairs of objects). A pair of objects is a set S such that, for some x and some y, x is a member of S and y is a member of S and x ≠ y and such that, for any z, if z is a member of S, then z = x or z = y. Thus, the number two is identical with the property of being a set S such that, for some x and some y, x ≠ y, and x is a member of S and y is a member of S, and for any z, if z is a member of S, then z = x or z = y. Notice that this analysis isn’t circular. “Two” is defined as “what all and only pairs of objects have in common,” and our definition of “pair of objects” uses no number expressions. Any given whole number is to be identified with a similar property. For example, the number three is the property of being a collection of three things (i.e., it is the property had by all and only such collections). Though this definition seems circular, it isn’t, since “collection of three things” can be defined without using the word “three” or any other number expression. To wit: S is a collection of three things iff there are objects x, y, and z such that x is a member of S and y is a member of S and z is a member of S; and such that x ≠ y and y ≠ z and x ≠ z; and such that, for any w, if z is a member of S, then w = x or w = y or w = z.

Thus, TLT says that: (TLT*) given any instance C of the number three (i.e., given any triple), and given any member x of that triple, any class C* that doesn’t contain x but is otherwise like C is an instance of the number two. Although number expressions occur in TLT*, these are all easily eliminated. A “triple” is any class K such that there are objects x, y, and z, all distinct, belonging to K and such that anything w belonging to K is identical with x or y or z. Since, as we know, “the number three” is the property of being a triple, the occurrence of “the number three” in TLT* is just shorthand for a much longer expression that contains no number-expressions at all, the same being true, for similar reasons, of the occurrence of “the number two.”",

If A1 is allowed to couple with each of Sally’s cars, the result is the set containing the pairs <A1,C1>, <A1,C2>, and <A1,C3>. In this context, A1 is applying a distinctive marker to each member of the smallest set containing each of Sally’s cars. A1 is marking C1, C2, and C3 with the ordered pairs <A1, C1>, <A1, C2>, and <A1,C3>, respectively. When you count your socks, you apply a distinctive marker to each sock. You mark the first sock with a “one,” the second with a “two,” etc. Thus, A1 is doing to each of Sally’s houses what you are doing when you count your socks. If Larry’s other apple is allowed to do the same thing mutatis mutandis, the result is the set containing the following pairs:<A2,C1>, <A2,C2>, and <A2,C3>. Notice that none of the markers used by A2 is identical with any of the markers used by A1. Thus, the two counts will be independent, in the sense that if Z is a set containing the one count, and Z* is a set containing the other, Z won’t overlap with Z*. Thus, union of Z and Z* can be thought of as the result of double counting Sally’s houses. The members of that union-set are: <A1,C1>, <A1,C2>, <A1,C3>, <A2,C1>, <A2,C2>, and <A2,C3>. That union-set, which is the Cartesian product of Z and Z*, is a six-membered set. It’s obvious that, given any two-membered set and any three-membered set, the union of the headcounts collectively done by both members of the two-membered set will be a six-membered set. In other words, the result of double counting the three membered set will be a six-membered set.

Given any arithmetical predicate P, there is a class of numbers C such that a whole number n belongs to C iff P(n) (read: “n has P”). Consider, for example, the predicate “is even.” There is obviously a class containing every number n such that ‹n is even› is true and containing no number m such that ‹m is even› is false. For argument’s sake, suppose there to be formal procedure FM such that, for any whole number n and any arithmetical predicate P, FM assigns a TRUE to the sentence P(n) if that sentence is true, and assigns a FALSE to if it’s false. (In this context, TRUE and FALSE may be thought of as physical stamps. When given an ink-deposit (or whatnot) that expresses an arithmetical proposition, FM stamps TRUE on that ink-deposit if it’s true and a FALSE on it if it’s false.) This is the same as assuming that: (1) There exists a formal procedure that correctly says of any given arithmetical statement whether it is true or false. Any given arithmetical predicate contains a finite number of letters. There are only finitely many different letters. This means that it’s possible to produce a list such that, given any finitely long combination of letters Z, there is some whole number n such that Z is the nth member of that list.

A moment ago we said that one can know that x is heavier than y without knowing the weights of either. This must be qualified. When you say that you know only the comparative weights of x and y, but don’t know the actual weight of either, what you are really saying is that, although you know how x and y compare to each other in respect of weight, you don’t know how either compares in that respect to objects in general. And when you say that you know the weights of x and y, and not merely their relative weights, you are saying that you know how each compares in respect of weight, not only with the other, but with objects in general. Thus, all knowledge of weight is comparative knowledge. The difference between knowing how x’s weight compares with y’s, on the one hand, and knowing how many pounds x weighs, on the other, is simply one of degree. ‹x weighs 27 lbs› is a condensed way of reporting a great many relative judgments concerning x’s weight—of reporting a great many judgments concerning x’s weight relative to some other object’s weight. What we think of as non-comparative knowledge is a condensed mass of comparative knowledge. It follows—though I leave it to the reader as an exercise to say exactly how it follows—that no viable analysis of a weight, or indeed of any other comparative property, is ever not an analysis by abstraction.",

But it’s held that to the extent, however limited that extent was, that he was able to formalize the making of inferences, he showed that suitably constructed machines could think. And those who hold this hold that others who, like Frege, have formalized some class of inferences have ipso facto shown that inferences could be made without thinking and could therefore be made by non-thinkers. This is deeply absurd. First of all, it’s tantamount to saying that thinking can be done without thinking. To make an inference is to think. So an unthinking being ipso facto can’t make inferences. This argument is likely to be seen as nothing more than a joke. And it is a joke. But it’s a joke only because, like any good joke, it states the obvious. In any case, here’s a joke-free argument. Suppose that device M is given tokens of (i) and (ii) as inputs and that, in response, it outputs a token of (iii). It doesn’t follow M has inferred anything. If M’s outputting T3 is to embody an inference of any kind, it isn’t enough that T1 and T2 be what led M to do so. It is necessary30 that their being symbols be what led M to output T3.

Because of experiments that I underwent as a child, I say “four” whenever I hear very loud sounds. You ask me “what is 2 + 2?” and I say “four.” But I say it not because of what it was that you were asking, but because you said it so loudly that my conditioning kicked in and I reflexively barked out “four.” My saying “four” was caused by a linguistic act on your part. But it wasn’t caused by your act’s being linguistic in nature. For this reason, my response wasn’t linguistic in nature. For exactly similar reasons, given only that M is outputting T3 in response to its being fed inputs T1 and T2, it doesn’t follow that M’s outputting T3 embodies an inference. Since it wasn’t in virtue of their being symbol-tokens that T1 and T2 led to M’s outputting T3, M’s outputting T3 is no more expressive or constitutive of a linguistic or inferential or otherwise ratiocinative act on M’s part than is my inadvertently getting a nose-bleed as a result of my hearing an extremely loud (and therefore nose-bleed-inducing) noise that happens also to be a case of somebody’s saying “if you get a nose-bleed right now, I’ll give you a million dollars.” Thus, so far as it’s correct to say that Frege “mechanized” thought, what it means is not that, thanks to his efforts, no thought is needed to execute inferences that were previously thought-dependent. It means that inferences that, prior to his efforts, had to made ad hoc could now be made in a systematic manner. Adding two multi-digit numbers together is easy if you use the standard algorithm, and it’s hard if you don’t. But, even if you use it, thought is involved. Applying the algorithm takes thought; and knowing that it’s applicable takes thought. Only a thinking being can make the judgment that given certain ink-marks (e.g. “456 + 785”) it is to be used, whereas given others, it isn’t. So even though it’s a lot harder to add multidigit numbers without the algorithm than with it, adding them with it involves thought. 6.1 Putting Frege’s successes into perspective (continued) The inferences one must make in order...",

Some of these property-instances are morphological (shape-related); others are chromatic (color-related); others are kinematic (motion-related). And so on. But you don’t just see various property-instances. You see an organized structure consisting of them. Your visual perception of Pat represents these property-instances as bearing various relations to one another. Being thus interrelated, they collectively form a coherent structure. Your seeing a coherent structure of property-instances, as opposed to a disorganized jumble of them, consists in your seeing various instances of various relations. It consists in your seeing that certain property-instances are to the right of certain others, that other property-instances are behind certain others, etc. Thus, your seeing Pat involves your seeing various instances of various properties and relations. It follows that your seeing him involves your being (visually, not verbally) apprised of an existence-claim: “there are, at the present moment, instances of such and such properties, in such and such places, bearing such and such relations to one another.” From now on, when I mention “property instances,” I am referring to instances of properties and of relations.1 We must now confront a delicate but deeply important question. You see Pat. That’s a given. This involves your seeing various instances of various properties and relations. That too is a given. But do you see anything other than property-instances instances?

No. Clearly you just see the instances. Your perception doesn’t represent Pat in addition to the various property-instances that are associated with him. Were your perception to have such a structure, it would involve Pat’s being represented to you as a featureless lump, a blank undifferentiated entity, with various property-instances piled on top of it, so to speak. But that clearly isn’t how that perception works. It’s absurd to suppose that a thing possibly be perceptually represented independently of the property-instances that it is being represented as having. That would involve its being represented as a featureless blank. The very idea of a thing’s being perceptually represented as a featureless blank is a non-starter.

If that individual has that property, then LS is true; otherwise, it isn’t. To put it more formally, there is some individual x (namely, Fred) such that LS attributes the property of being a professor of economics to x and such that LS is true if and only if (LP) x is a professor of economics. But given how you learned who “Fred” refers to, what LS conveys won’t be so threadbare. True—for some object x (namely Fred), SF merely slaps the label “Fred” on x. But your knowledge of SF is replete with non-semantic content. You know of Fred’s existence only because he was described to you. In seeing him, you were visually told that there was some individual x such that you met x at a certain time, in a certain place, and such that x had certain characteristics; and you were also told that “Fred” was x’s name. Your perception of him was therefore descriptive, and the same is therefore true of your subsequent concept of him. Given that you cognitively access SF through this information, what LS communicates to you is likely to be along the lines of: (LPC) There was, a little while ago a certain object x having such and such characteristics (e.g., was wearing a checkered shirt and nervously wringing its hands, etc.) and “Fred” refers to x and I’ve just been told that: x is a professor of economics.

But, the circumstances being what they are, we know that, whoever he is, he’s important. You and I are going to be talking about him a lot. We thus need a way of referring to him that, unlike the “the man in the distance,” won’t cease to be useful the moment he moves to a new place. We thus decide to give him a name.

That person, whoever he is, can move to a new place; and some other person who isn’t identical with him can move into the place that he has vacated.

(Note: Russell and Frege disagreed about how to analyze ‹the phi.› Frege thought that it was a referring term. Russell thought otherwise. But they both accepted RF, and that’s what’s important here.) So “Homer” is, in their view, synonymous with “the blind bard who authored the Iliad,” or some such, and “Shakespeare” is synonymous with “the author of Hamlet,” or some such.

In other words, supposing that O is what “Hesperus” picks out, it either is, or is not, by virtue of O’s fitting some description that “Hesperus” picks out it. If it is, then “Hesperus” is ipso facto a non-rigid designator—a definite description. For supposing that the description that O must satisfy is unique thing having phi, “Hesperus” must be synonymous with ‹the phi.› But we know, from Kripke himself, that “Hesperus” is not synonymous with any such expression. So “Hesperus” does not refer to O through the mediation of a description. It picks O out—but not because it has this or that property. It picks it out because the semantic rule for “Hesperus” is to the effect that, no matter what properties O has, “Hesperus” is to pick it out—because, in other words, “Hesperus” picks out O, this not being contingent on O’s satisfying any condition (other than its being O). Thus, there is some object x (namely, O) such that the semantic rule for “Hesperus” is to the effect that, no matter how O is, “Hesperus” picks it out. In other words, “Hesperus” picks out O directly. It is directly referential. A consequence is, for some object x (such that x is Hesperus) such that, in virtue of having the form, ‹Hesperus has psi›, a sentence is true if and only if x has phi. For exactly similar reasons, “Phosphorous” is directly referential. It co-refers with “Hesperus.” Thus, there is some object x (such that x is Hesperus and Phosphorous) such that, in virtue of having the form, ‹Hesperus has psi›, a sentence is true if and only if x has phi and such that, in virtue of having the form, ‹Phosphorous has psi›, a sentence is true if and only if x has phi. Thus, ‹Hesperus has psi›and ‹Phosphorous has psi› have the very same literal meaning. In general, inter-substituting “Hesperus” and “Phosphorous” doesn’t change literal meaning.

There are others who grasp the semantics of “London” but don’t associate that property with that expression. The sense of “London” varies from person to person.

But that’s irrelevant. After I die, P1 won’t be true; it will be false to say, at that point, that JMK plays tennis, the reason being that, sadly, he won’t be doing anything. But our analysis is consistent with that. After I die, PJMK won’t be instantiated. It will be true at that point that JMK did play tennis. But our analysis is consistent with that fact as well. The sentence: (S2) “JMK used to play tennis” says the same thing as: (S3) the proposition that JMK plays tennis used to be true.

A story will make this clear. Your friend Smith, who is generally pretty credible, tells you a story about a friend of his who has the unusual name of “Gigantus.” You don’t know Gigantus. When Smith first tells you about him, he says: (SG15) “My friend Gigantus is truly extraordinary. Gigantus was the first person to translate the complete works of Shakespeare into Albanian. Gigantus used to be a professor, but he now lives in the woods. He actually lives in a hollowed out tree trunk.

Of course, these stories are replete with statements of the form ‹...Gigantus...› (e.g., “Gigantus recently read War and Peace,” “You’d really like Gigantus if you met him,” etc.). It goes without saying that, at least from your viewpoint, these statements aren’t like ES, let alone “blarg blurbo gloxo.” They’re quite as meaningful as “Socrates was a fine orator.” Then one day Smith tells you that there is no Gigantus. Smith made him up. It was all a hoax. There is no individual x such that “Gigantus” refers to x.

Nor would it have been advisable for us to do so. “Gigantus” isn’t a definite description. It’s a proper name, albeit an empty one. Whatever it is that utterances of ‹...Gigantus...› might communicate, it isn’t because “Gigantus” is a definite description that they communicate it. Notice that our analysis is a very conservative one. We didn’t posit any new entities. We didn’t assume facts not in evidence (e.g., we didn’t presuppose the truth of any uncorroborated hypotheses or otherwise prejudge open questions). Now let’s look at what Nathan Salmon says about empty proper names, like “Gigantus.” He says that socalled “empty” proper names aren’t empty. He says that “Zeus” does refer to a Greek God. He says that “Vulcan” does refer to an actual planet. (“Vulcan” was the name given by astronomers in the 19th century to a planet that they posited, but that turned out not to exist.) Salmon concedes that Zeus and Vulcan don’t exist in space-time. If you flew around the solar system, you’d never come across Vulcan; if you climbed Mt. Olympus, you’d never see Zeus. But they do exist—they exist, Salmon says, as abstract entities. Salmon’s primary reason for accepting this view is that, since he thinks that names are mere labels, he (rightly) doesn’t see it as an option to see “Vulcan” and “Zeus” as being synonymous or identical with definite descriptions. But he finds it puzzling that, for any psi, utterances of ‹Zeus has psi› and ‹Vulcan has psi› are so rich in communicated meaning. He doesn’t consider the proposal that we put forth a moment ago, and instead tries to solve the problem by saying that, in fact, “Vulcan” and “Zeus” do refer to things. This isn’t necessary. It’s also pointless. What is communicated by sentence-utterances of the form ‹Joseph Biden has psi› and ‹Charles Keating has psi›, and other sentence-utterances containing no non-empty names, diverges dramatically from what such utterances literally mean. This is a well-known fact. So what it is that “Joseph Biden is a democrat” conveys cannot be explained solely in terms of what it literally means.

In particular, it follows that: (W8) “water is H2O” will convey the message that: (W9) there is something x that is a clear liquid in bathtubs, etc., and is referred to as “water”; moreover, x is H2O (i.e., consists of dihydrogen monoxide molecules), even though there is something L such that W8’s literal meaning is: (W10) L is H2O. W9 is a posteriori. But it’s also contingent. Water doesn’t have to be in bathtubs. (There was water before there were bathtubs.) So we don’t yet have anything that’s both necessary and a posteriori. But, of course, it isW10, not W9, that is W8’s literal meaning. For the appropriate value of L, W10 is indeed necessary (just as Kripke says). But is W10 a posteriori? We must make two preliminary points before we take a stand on this delicate question. First, we must distinguishW10 from the information through which it might be grasped. W9 is an example of the sort of descriptive information through one graspsW10. Since one grasps W10 through such propositions, it’s easy to attribute their features to it. Since they are contingent, and we grasp W10 through them, it’s easy to think that W10 is contingent. The second point involves our outlining points that will be discussed more fully in Chapter 9. Consider the proposition: (JS) John snores. Under what circumstances is it true? The property of being identical with John must be instantiated. The property of being a smoker must be instantiated. And the property of being something that is and is also a smoker must be instantiated. We can thus identify JS with a set S consisting of those three properties (viz. that of being identical with John, that of being a smoker, and that of being a thing that is John that is smoking). Since all the members of S are instantiated if and only if JS is true, we may identify JS’s being true with its being the case that all the members of JS are instantiated. Thus, JS may be identified with a set of properties, and the fact that it’s true may be identified with the fact that those properties...",

In other words, W10 is true just in case: (W11) anything that is H2O is H2O which, though necessary, is a priori.

Given that you now know E4, you can forget each of E1–E3 without ceasing to be able to think about Fred. And, so long as you are able to think about Fred, this will continue to be the case.

Thus, an integral part of one’s ability to think about or refer to an external object is one’s having knowledge of an existence-claim that it uniquely satisfies; i.e., it is my having a uniquely individuating description of him. None of this belittles the role that causal connections play in conception and reference. I am able to think about, and refer to, Fred precisely because I saw him: and seeing something involves being causally connected to it. But how is the causal connection involved?

The causal connection is involved in my seeing Fred; and my seeing Fred, in its turn, is involved in my having a uniquely individuating description of him. So what is doing the work is my knowledge of a uniquely individuating description of Fred; the causal connection, though essential, has a role that is subordinate and internal to my knowledge of that description.

People obviously had thoughts about water; they wanted to drink it; bathe in it, and so on.

On Twin-Earth, there is somebody who, at any given moment, is psychologically and behaviorally just like Smith. (This follows from what we said earlier.) Let Twin-Smith be that person. At any given time, Twin-Smith makes the very noises as Smith and, in so doing, expresses the very sentiments. (This too follows from our earlier points.)

Even the most philistine, intellectually narrow human being desperately wants real diamonds, not zirconium imitation diamonds, and thus knows that being diamond-like isn’t the same thing as being a diamond. Similarly, everybody knows that being water-like isn’t the same thing as being real water. And even if some people don’t know it, they’d quickly learn it, no matter how scientifically uninformed they were, if the distinction between water and XYZ became a financially significant one, like the distinction between diamonds and chunks of zirconium paste that resemble diamonds. For the same reasons mutatis mutandis, on Twin-Earth “water” would refer to XYZ, not H2O. And it would always have referred to XYZ—even before scientists on their planet discovered its chemical composition. Before proceeding, let’s deal with an objection that is likely to be heard: An English-speaking physical chemist obviously knows a lot about water that other English speakers don’t . But what the physical chemist knows that other English speakers don’t has nothing to do with the English language or, therefore, with semantics. Given only that somebody doesn’t have a PhD in physical chemistry, it doesn’t follow that they have any linguistic deficits—that they don’t really know the identities of the semantic rules governing expressions like “water,” “gold,” “lead,” etc. This is all quite uncontroversial. But it’s inconsistent with the view you (speaking on Putnam’s behalf) are advocating. You say that, for something to be water, it isn’t enough that it have certain macro-characteristics: it must have a specific chemical composition—it must be H2O. Given that, as a matter of semantics, “water” refers to water, what you’re saying entails that, as a matter of semantics, “water” refers to H2O. But if that were right, one couldn’t master the English language without knowing the chemical composition of water or, by obvious extensions of this argument, the chemical composition of gold or aluminum. But that’s preposterous. One doesn’t have to know anything about chemistry to have a complete mastery of English (or any other natural language), and it would be preposterous to deny that. But the view I’m describing doesn’t have that consequence. There is some individual x such that the semantic rule for the expression “Barack Obama” is to the effect that: (BO) “Barack Obama...",

(In this context, it is to be assumed that Smith is speaking sincerely, is cognitively competent, etc., and these same assumptions are to be made about Twin-Smith). Like Smith, Twin-Smith regards AU as expressing a truth. But, according to Burge, the thought underlying Twin-Smith’s utterance of AU is different from the thought underlying Smith’s utterance of it. Twin-Smith is thinking about twin-arthritis, not arthritis, and Smith is thinking about arthritis, not twin-arthritis. In a moment, we’ll evaluate this important claim. Burge concludes from this that two people who are atom-for-atom duplicates of each other, each a perfect physiological and psychological clone of the other, may have thoughts with different contents. Twin-Smith is thinking Descartes (or Twin-Descartes, rather) was a great philosopher, whereas Smith is thinking Ted Danson is a great philosopher, notwithstanding that Smith and Twin-Smith are, by Burge’s hypothesis, psychologically exactly the same. Is Burge right? First of all, he’s right that, on Twin-Earth, “arthritis” doesn’t refer to arthritis, and instead refers to twin-arthritis. This is precisely what Putnam showed. But is Burge right that Smith and Twin-Smith are cognitively different? No. How does Smith learn what “arthritis” refers to? Here’s a possible answer (and it’s representative, in the relevant respects, of all the other possible answers). Addressing Smith, so and so says: (A1) “the unpleasant inflammation in your knees is due to arthritis; arthritis can do terrible damage to one’s joints.” A1 is to the effect that: (A2) there is some x such that the swelling in your knees is due to x and such that x can do terrible damage to one’s joints; moreover, “arthritis” refers to x. For now familiar reasons, it follows that when Smith hears someone say: (A3) “arthritis has psi,” the message that is communicated (not literally meant) is: (A4) There is some x such that the swelling in your knees is due to x, such that x can do terrible damage to one’s joints, and such that “arthritis” refers to x; moreover, “arthritis” refers to x. Remember that Twin-Smith’s life precisely parallels Smith’s. It therefore follows that, when Twin-Smith hears someone utter (A3), is the message that is communicated (not literally meant) is (A4).

Since the mental activity underlying U4 is obviously based on VH, Burge’s view entails that no thought underlies that utterance. Burge’s position is preposterous. It’s obvious that VH gives me a complete message. It tells me that there is an individual in a certain place who wearing a plaid shirt (etc.). More precisely, it tells me that: (CVR) There is some entity x such that x has such and such characteristics, such that x is standing is in a certain place and such that x is wearing a plaid shirt. CVR is a false message, of course. But that only proves our point, since false messages are complete messages. Burge’s analysis entails that the message given to me by my visual experience is BLNK, not CVR. Since BLNK, unlike the message that is in fact given to me, is neither true nor false, Burge’s analysis is false.",

To the extent that what I am doing right now is thinking D*, JMK* is altogether failing to have a thought. He’s shooting a cognitive blank. That doesn’t mean that he isn’t thinking anything. But to the extent that what I’m thinking right now is D*, he isn’t thinking anything. That means that all of the psychological activity that, in my case, is mediating the thought that D* is, in JMK*’s case, failing to mediate anything. And supposing that, for a split second, D* were the one thought passing through my mind, it follows on Burge’s view that JMK* is, during that split second, not thinking anything at all. Thus, a consequence of Burge’s view is that, given two people who are psychologically identical, one of them may be having a thought whereas the other is thinking nothing at all. But not only is that clearly false: it’s incoherent. Thought is psychological activity. Burge’s view has the absurd result that thought isn’t a psychological process.18 4.1.2 Burge’s response19 Burge denies that his position is inconsistent with the presumption that people know what they are consciously thinking. To evaluate this claim of his, let’s start out by saying what he does admit. Burge admits three things, which we’ll refer to as “B1,” “B2,” and “B3”: (B1) No matter what mental states I have, it’s a possibility that Descartes didn’t exist. The documents on which my belief is based could have been forged (etc.). Thus, even though (so I think, and so let us assume) I do know that Descartes existed (at least insofar as I know anything about what happened in France centuries ago), I don’t know for sure that he did. Moreover, given only what my own mental states are, it’s a theoretical possibility that he never did exist. (B2) For argument’s sake, suppose that, in reality, Descartes really did exist. Let’s also suppose that I’m now thinking: (D*) Descartes was a fine philosopher. A consequence of my (Burge’s) position is that there existed some individual x, namely Descartes, such that D* is correct if and only if (D1*) x was a fine philosopher and such that the mental events and structures involved in my having that thought are correct if and only if D1* is correct.

B4 is wrong. I obviously know what I’m consciously thinking with greater certainty than I know about medieval France. I want to make it as clear as possible why B1–B3 entail B4. Given B2, I can think D* only to the extent that Descartes really did exist. Burge admits this. (He has to. B2 is Burge’s whole position.) Given B1, I can know that he existed only to the extent that various beliefs of mine concerning the external world to be accurate—beliefs that presuppose the accuracy of many perceptions of mine and also of many historical documents. Burge admits this as well. B3 entails that there is no experiential difference—no difference that is even theoretically detectable—between how I am when I’m actually thinking D*1 and how I am in a world where Descartes never existed but is otherwise like the world where I’m actually thinking D*1. B3 entails that, if I am to know that I’m thinking D*1, or anything else about Descartes, I’d jolly well better know that he existed; and I’d therefore jolly well better know that various Descartes-related perceptions of mine were accurate and, in addition, that various inferences of mine concerning various records of mine were also accurate. Which means that a precondition for my thinking about Descartes is my knowing that Descartes existed Which, in its turn, means that, supposing that I’m consciously thinking about Descartes right now, I can’t possibly know that fact with very much certainty at all. I can know it only with the certainty with which I know that Descartes existed. But that’s false. Since knowing that Descartes existed obviously involves knowing a lot of other things about the external world—since it involves my knowing that I was in fact reading certain books at certain terms, that certain records in fact exist and were made under certain circumstances, etc.—my knowing a huge amount about the external world is a prerequisite to knowing that I’m thinking this or that about Descartes.

    "text": "Consider the statement: (#) Circles are figures of uniform curvature. # is true. And you know that it's true. You thus have knowledge of #. How does one become justified in believing #? Answer: by examining the statement itself. More specifically, by examining the components of that statement—the concepts circle, curvature, uniform, and so on. So your knowledge of # is purely conceptual. In other words, it is “analytic.” Analytic knowledge is so-called because it is acquired by analyzing the object of belief. Whenever statement-analysis is sufficient, by itself, to yield knowledge, that knowledge is analytic. Most knowledge is non-analytic. Consider the statement: (##) Donald Rumsfeld was born in the United States. An examination of that statement is not enough to know whether it is true or false. It doesn’t matter how much you dissect it and examine its components. In order to be justified in having a view, one way or the other, as to whether it is true, and in order therefore to know whether it is true, it is necessary to consider matters of fact of which no amount of conceptual analysis will apprise you. It is necessary to look at birth records or to ask informed people, or some such. Thus, if one knows that ## is true, that knowledge is non-conceptual. In other words, it is non-analytic or, as philosophers sometimes say, synthetic. 4.1 More on the analytic-synthetic distinction Although some philosophers have held otherwise, I think it is fair to say that synthetic knowledge is identical with knowledge of spatiotemporal facts, whereas analytic knowledge is knowledge of properties.3 To know ##, for example, is to know something about the spatiotemporal world—the world of things that occupy space and time. By contrast, to know # is to know about unchanging, non-temporal (and therefore non-spatial) relations among properties. In this chapter, we will operate on the reasonable, though debatable, assumption that all synthetic knowledge is knowledge of some fact or other about the spatiotemporal realm. So, in this context, the terms “spa-tiotemporal knowledge” and “synthetic knowledge” may be used interchangeably. In Chapter 18, it is shown that, in fact, synthetic knowledge is identical with spatiotemporal knowledge.",

If x causes y, that is because there is some law of nature to the effect that things that, in some relevant respect, resemble x always bring about things that, in some relevant respect, are like y. Causal relations typically involve sequences of events. But not all sequences of events are causal. When I bring my hands together quickly, a noise occurs—there is a clapping sound. That sequence of events is clearly causal in nature: the collision of my hands caused the sound to occur. But suppose that, just after I bring my hands together, one of you suddenly feels a tickle. That is not a causal sequence: it’s just a coincidence. The natural law of which a given causal sequence is an instance is known as the covering law for that sequence. To know a natural law is to know a fact about the spatiotemporal world. Natural laws are not in the same category as #: such laws are not of a strictly logical, philosophical, or mathematical nature. It is not possible to know of natural laws merely on the basis of conceptual analysis. Such knowledge can be acquired only through investigation of the spatiotemporal world. It is only through such investigation that one can know that the speed of light is 186,000 mph/second, that objects gain mass as they accelerate, that the force with which two bodies attract each other is proportional to their masses. Of course, some natural laws strike us as extremely obvious. We find it obvious that unsupported objects fall. But that is not because such knowledge is analytic; it is only because the relevant spatiotemporal knowledge constantly forces itself upon us. Even though knowledge of natural law is spatiotemporal knowledge, such knowledge tends to have a highly general character and is thus, in that respect, comparable to many cases of analytic knowledge (e.g., one’s knowledge of #). Knowledge of the laws of physics is very general knowledge. To know such laws is to know this or that specific fact, and is instead to know a fact about how events in general are interrelated. But most spatiotemporal knowledge is highly specific.

It’s only thanks to our knowledge that 6 divided by 2 is 3, along with out knowledge that Smith is six feet tall, that we know that Smith would be 3 feet tall in a world where he were half his actual height. It’s only thanks to our knowledge that Kennedy was an enormously popular first-term President, along with our knowledge that popular incumbent Presidents win re-election, that we know that Kennedy would have won in 1964 had his life not been cut short.

Good pianists, unlike their bad counterparts, have internalized the relevant rules and, for that reason, don’t need crutch of conscious, discursive mentation.

In another work (not in the Meditations), Descartes famously says “I think; therefore I am.” We have just seen the meaning of this. One cannot think without existing. Since doubting is a form of thinking, and since thinking involves existing, one cannot doubt one’s existence without existing. Therefore, doubt as to one’s own existence is incoherent. This gives Descartes an Archimedean point on which to build the structure of human knowledge: he knows that he exists; and, so he believes, he can on that basis justify all of the beliefs that we pretheoretically regard as true (e.g., that there is an external world with people and rocks and dogs in it). Descartes makes another good point about the difference between knowledge of self and knowledge of the world. As just noted, given only that you have an experience like that of seeing a stick, it doesn’t follow that there really is a stick there. But given only that you have an experience like that of being in pain, it does follow that you really are in pain. After all, an experience like pain is pain, whereas an experience like that of seeing a stick isn’t necessarily an experience of seeing a stick. Descartes seems to hold that what we just said about knowledge of pain is true of all cases of self-knowledge. This is, in my view, a gross over-statement. But we don’t need to pursue this, since it isn’t central to Descartes’ main project; and Descartes’ core point (that at least certain kinds of self-awareness couldn’t be delusional) seems correct. Descartes makes another, extremely clever point. He says that, although we think that our basic beliefs about the physical world are purely perceptual, those beliefs are actually replete with inferential, even theoretical, content.

But here, as Descartes points out, we run into a problem. Even though we seem to have some correct beliefs, we’re also disastrously wrong a great deal of the time. If God is so well-disposed towards us, why would he let us have so many wrong beliefs? Here Descartes provides a rather Byzantine argument, which may be summarized as follows. God has given us free will. That was good of him to do, of course, since we’d rather be free than be robots. Next step: We arrive at wrong beliefs only when we abuse our free will. Just as a person may abuse his/her free will by doing drugs, so he/she may abuse it by drawing inferences without sufficient evidence. So, being good, God had no choice but to give us free will. But since we have free will, some of us will inevitably abuse it and make wrong inferences (and also do other bad things). But, says Descartes, there is a bright side to this story. If we don’t draw conclusions that are not warranted by the evidence, we’ll have only correct beliefs. Here Descartes ends up putting forth an argument to the effect that most of our beliefs about the external world are correct, and that argument has both foundationalist and coherentist elements. (It’s a pretty good argument, I think, even though two of the premises are clearly false.) First of all, we have self-evidently correct beliefs about our mental states (as we discussed a while ago). Second, something never comes from nothing and, moreover, effects resemble their causes. So the perceptions that we have must have causes and, moreover, they must resemble those causes. Further, Descartes says, those causes don’t lie within us. How do we know this? Because, Descartes says, one’s mind is completely transparent to its owner; and when a given person looks inside himself, he doesn’t encounter anything that resembles the perception he is having of (say) the table in front of him—he just encounters the perception. So the causes of our perceptions must lie in the external world. Thus, our perceptions are accurate, at least most of the time, the same being true of the beliefs based thereupon.

So God exists. In Chapter 25, it is explained why this argument fails. 7.0 Meditation 6: “Of the existence of material things, and of the distinction between the mind and body of man” Here Descartes puts forth his (in)famous argument for mind-body dualism, the doctrine that mental entities (e.g., beliefs) are not identical with physical entities (e.g., patterns of neural stimulation). Here is that argument. Let x be a belief. Suppose that I rightly believe x to be a belief. In other words, suppose that x has the property of being believed by me to be a belief. For any pattern of neural stimulation y, it doesn’t follow that I believe that y is a belief. That is, it doesn’t follow that y has the property of being believed by me to be a belief. So x and y don’t have the same properties and therefore cannot be identical. The customary response to this argument is to say that it involves an “intensional fallacy.” Benjamin Franklin was the first postmaster general and he was also the inventor of bifocals. So the first postmaster general = the inventor of bifocals. But one can believe that the first postmaster general = the first postmaster general without believing that the first postmaster general = the inventor of bifocals. And from the fact that one can have the first belief without having the second, it obviously doesn’t follow, and it isn’t the case, that the first postmaster general ≠ the inventor of bifocals. For the same reason, from the fact that believing that belief x = belief x doesn’t entail believing that belief x = pattern of neural stimulation y, it doesn’t follow that x ≠ y. The idea is that, in certain sentential contexts, Leibniz’s Law breaks down (or, rather, appears to breakdown), and that verbs such as “believe,” “know,” and “doubt” create such contexts. Such contexts are referred to as “intensional” contexts. A context that is not “intensional” is “extensional.” So a context is “intensional” if it is one where there can be an apparent violation of Leibniz’s Law, and a context is otherwise “extensional.” Why, exactly, intensional contexts are created by certain expressions is an extremely delicate...",

Later we’ll discuss why, despite their obvious falseness, people have held (3)–(5). First of all, (2) is not the view that mental entities don’t exist. (2) must be distinguished at all costs from (4). According to (2), perceptions, beliefs, doubts, and so on, all exist—but they are identical with brain-states. The materialist says that, just as water is H2O, so your belief that 1 + 1 = 2 is identical with some pattern of neural stimulation (or some such). Just as the physical chemist isn’t denying the existence of water in identifying it with H2O, so the materialist isn’t denying the existence of the mental in identifying it with physical entities. Although there may be some tendency on the part of materialists to be dismissive of certain features of the psychological realm, they don’t have to be thus dismissive: Chomsky is a materialist, as was Freud—and those two were nothing if not great believers in the psyche. Advocates of (2) typically (but not universally) hold that mental entities are identical with brain-events and brain-structures. For obvious reasons, they don’t usually hold that mental entities are identical with trees or rocks or anything else that is not a part of one’s body (or, more specifically, one’s central nervous system). I have published some papers arguing for dualism. I am now a materialist. But I am still fundamentally open on this issue. Here are my own views. I believe (as I just said) that materialism is correct. Second, I believe (very strongly) that functionalism (a very popular form of materialism: to be defined later) is wrong.

But I cannot find any errors in the just-stated counter-response (though others claim to be able to do so). If you can identify some consideration that resolves the matter, or that gives some weight to a certain (attempted) way of resolving the matter, I would be extremely interested in what you have to say. Second argument for dualism—the explanatory gap Consider some psychological statement; for example, (P) Last year I was very sad, because I completely failed in my efforts to write a best-selling novel. (P) is obviously the kind of statement that could be true. But can the truth of (P) be understood in terms of facts about neural-firings? Can we conceive of some statement about a person’s body that made it clear why (P) was true? Of course, we can imagine discovering that people feel sad when, and only when, certain neurons in their brains are firing. But would such a discovery really give us any insight into the nature of the dependence (if any there be) of that psychological fact on the existence of those neural states of affairs? Let us generalize this point. There is no denying that we can discover psycho-physical concomitances; that is, that we can discover truths of the form mental phenomenon m occurs when, and only when, physical phenomenon p occurs. But there always seems to be a “gap” between the neural event and the associated psychological event. Permit me to clarify this last point. Water is H2O. Of course, when you look at a glass of water, you cannot see that it consists of H2O molecules. But suppose that you could shrink yourself down to the size of such a molecule. In that case, you could literally see the molecules with which physical chemists identify water. When you look at a brain, you see beige tissue—you don’t see emotions, beliefs, etc. If you were to shrink yourself down the size of a molecule, you still wouldn’t see emotions, beliefs, etc. In other words, you still wouldn’t see the entities that the materialist identifies with brain-states.9 You would see the entities with which the physical chemist identifies brain-states (atoms, molecules of various kinds) but not, as we just said, those with which the materialist identifies...",

Even if the fact that Jerry is sad cannot be understood in terms of the fact that Jerry’s brain is in such and such a condition, it doesn’t follow that Jerry’s sadness isn’t identical with his brain’s being in that condition. We know that biological phenomena (e.g., digestion, respiration) are identical with interactions of atomic and sub-atomic parts. But there would be no way to translate a biological statement (e.g. “Smith is now breathing”) into a statement about atoms bouncing off of one another. Because statements belonging to biology involve concepts (e.g., respiration) that aren’t found in physics, it is to be expected that the former are not going to be capable of being translated into, or otherwise understood in terms of, the latter. Biology talk isn’t physics talk, even though all biological events are physical events. Similarly, psychology talk isn’t physics talk (or chemistry talk or biology talk), even though psychological events are physical events. Because psychology uses concepts not found in any physical science (e.g., chemistry or physics), it is to be expected that statements belonging to the former are not going to be capable of being translated into, or otherwise understood in terms of, statements belonging to the former to the latter.11 Counter-response Although this argument obviously has merit, and is widely accepted, I am not convinced by it.

This viewpoint is defended in Sections 9.1–9.2.1 of the present chapter.12 A counter-response to the counter-response The mental can be understood in terms of the physical.

Next-step: identity holds necessarily if it holds at all. If x and y are identical, then they are necessarily so. Proof16: suppose that x and y are identical, but only contingently so. Obviously x cannot be contingently identical with itself. So if x and y are contingently identical, then y has a property that x lacks: y has the property of being contingently identical with x, whereas x does not have the property. Thus, contrary to our supposition, x is not identical with y, showing that it is incoherent to suppose that there is such a thing as “contingent” identity. Thus, given that (*) could be true, and given that identity holds necessarily if it holds at all, it follows that feelings (and, for exactly similar reasons, beliefs and pains) are not brain-states. This argument evaluated First of all, it is easy to adapt what we said about (i) and (ii) to this argument. So this refinement of Descartes’ argument is, like the first, guilty of the intensional fallacy. But there’s another reason to question that argument. According to many contemporary philosophers, not all necessity is analytic. The sentence “water is identical with H2O,” it is said, expresses a proposition that, although non-analytic, is necessarily true. There is no possible circumstance where water is anything other than H2O. There are circumstances where liquids that, in terms of their macroscopic properties, resemble water are not H2O. But there are no circumstances where water is not H2O. Why is this? The categories in terms of which science explains the world are known as “natural kinds.” Examples of natural kinds are zebra, metal, proton, water, emotion, human being, acid, base, star and penguin. Natural kinds are generated by properties that are predictively and explanatorily fecund. Properties that don’t have those virtues (e.g., person who drives a green car, edible substance on Larry’s table) don’t generate natural kinds. The property of being H2O generates a natural kind. Two things that are explanatorily and predictively very different can, at least within the narrow horizons within which non-experimentalists typically operate, be indistinguishable in respect of their macro-characteristics.

The reason that WH is non-analytic is that something that appeared, visually and otherwise, to be just like water might not be water, as it might have the wrong micro-structure. In general, whenever a statement of the form x = y is non-analytic, it is because objects that aren’t x can appear just like x. But it makes no sense to say that something that appeared (felt) just like a pain wasn’t actually a pain. Anything that feels just like a pain is a pain. “Pain is identical with brain state X” would be non-analytic, if it were true. Thus, since what makes it possible for it to be non-analytic that water is H2O is that appearing like water is different from being water, and the same thing mutatis mutandis being true of all non-analytic necessities, it follows that “pain is identical with brain state X” is not true. 10.0 Arguments for materialism First argument for materialism: It is obvious the mental events create, and otherwise affect, physical events; and it is obvious that physical events create, and otherwise affect, mental events. A hot iron is pressed to your skin (physical event); as a result, you feel pain (mental event). You intend to go to the store (mental event); as a result, you end up going to the store (physical event). You feel nervous (mental event); as a result, your heart races (physical event). There is extremely strong evidence to the effect that any physical event is the result only of other physical events. To explain why a person’s body moves a certain way, it is necessary only to know what the strictly physical (neural, muscular, . . .) antecedents of that event are, and it is not necessary to know what its psychological antecedents are. The behavior of a person’s body is no more in need of “mentalistic” explanation than is the behavior of a brick. (Of course, a knowledge of a person’s psychological condition is often sufficient, given knowledge of easy-to-ascertain facts about the external world, for a knowledge of what that person is going to do next. But such knowledge is not necessary: such predictions can, in principle, be made without having any knowledge as to the relevant person’s psychology.)

Hence (ii) is the right view.18 Evaluating this argument: My own personal view is that this argument is pretty solid, that being why I am a materialist. Others have responded (or, given their positions, would respond) differently to this argument. For example, according to epiphenomenalism, even though the physical affects the mental, the mental does not affect the physical. But epiphenomenalism is clearly wrong. It’s an empirical datum that the mental affects the physical and vice versa. Should it be denied that this is a datum, or even that it’s true, I would respond by showing that epiphenomenalism is at odds with a fundamental fact about the nature of causation. Causation is bidirectional. If my hand affects the table (e.g., if my hand pushes the table), then the table affects my hand. So if, as the epiphenomenalist believes, the physical affected the mental, then the mental would affect the physical. But in that case, epiphenomenalism is false.",

    "text": "The epiphenomenalist might counter-respond by saying that there are exceptions to the principle of bidirectionality that I’ve been advocating: physical situations create, and have effects on, shadows; but shadows don’t have effects on anything. But this move is a non-starter. Mental entities, unlike shadows, really do have causal powers. Even the epiphenomenalist doesn’t deny that they affect one another. Given this fact, along with the fact mental events result from physical events, it follows that some of the energy associated with physical states of affairs is transferred to them. So unless energy is implausibly assumed to vanish from the physical world, never to return, we must assume that the mental can, so to speak, spit it back into the physical world and, therefore, that the mental can affect the physical.19 And, as we’ve seen, once it is granted the mental can affect the physical, it must be granted that the mental is physical. Another argument for materialism As we’ve seen, the mental clearly affects the physical. If mental entities are subject to physical laws, they are ipso facto physical. (After all, what would it be to be physical, if not to obey physical laws?) And if something obeys physical laws, it is ipso facto physical. What would it mean to say “X obeys the laws of physics —but it isn’t physical”? X is physical iff X obeys physical laws. Thus, if mental entities are not physical, they are not subject to physical laws. So if mental entities were non-physical, things that didn’t fall within the scope of physical law would constantly have effects on the physical world, resulting in physical events that couldn’t be explained in terms of physical laws—in physical events that were, in fact, violations of physical law. But such violations do not occur. In any case, there is no evidence that they occur, and certainly no evidence that they occur with anything even approaching the frequency with which, if dualism were correct, they would occur.20 A counter-response Surely we could imagine physical objects breaking physical laws. We can imagine people sprouting wings and flying—even though, given the structures of our bodies, such events would be violations of physical law.

(Skepticism is the focus of Chapter 12 in its entirety and of Sections 6.0–8.0 of Chapter 13.) 12.0 The different versions of materialism-behaviorismThere are different versions of materialism. Let us now consider them, starting with behaviorism. According to the behaviorist, to believe that 1 + 1 = 2 is only to have a disposition to respond with certain overt behaviors to certain physical stimuli. If when asked “what is 1 + 1?,” you say “2”—if, in general, you respond to sensory inputs in ways that are characteristic of a belief that 1 + 1 = 2—then in virtue of that very fact, you believe that 1 + 1 = 2. In other words, according to the behaviorist, behaving in the right way is believing that 1 + 1 = 2. It isn’t a consequence of such knowledge. It is such knowledge.25 The general definition of behaviorism is this. If M is any mental category, P is an instance of M just in case P is a disposition on the part of some individual to respond with certain overt behaviors to certain sensory inputs. Behaviorism is false. How a person reacts to a given sensory input is a function, not only of what that input is, but also of what that person’s existing mental states are. If you don’t speak English, an utterance of “what is 1 + 1?” will not cause you to say “2.” It is only in people who have various pieces of background knowledge (e.g., knowledge of linguistic conventions) that such a disposition corresponds to a knowledge that 1 + 1 = 2. What we said about that particular disposition is true (mutatis mutandis) of any other. By itself, no disposition to engage in a certain kind of overt behavior, given certain stimuli, corresponds to any mental state: what does so is such a disposition plus various pre-existing mental states. So mental states cannot be reduced",

But even though any given mental entity is to be understood in terms of other mental entities, nonetheless the totality of a person’s mental entities can be understood entirely in terms of strictly physical inputs and strictly behavioral outputs. Let MS (short for “mental sentence”) be a single, very large sentence that says, for any given mental kind (e.g., belief that snow is white, dread of visiting one’s mother in law, etc.), what the causes and effects of instances of that kind are. MS is going to contain “constants”: it will contain expressions, such as “dread of going jogging in the morning,” that refer to kinds of mental entities. Given any such expression, replace it with a variable. The result will be an open sentence (an expression that contains a free variable but is otherwise just like a sentence). Bind the occurrences of that variable in that open sentence with an existential quantifier. Do the same thing mutatis mutandis for each occurrence of any expression that refers to a mental kind. But don’t do it for any of the expressions that refer to physical kinds. The result will be a sentence that completely describes the causes and effects of instances of each mental kind, but that does so without using any expressions that refer to anything mental. The mental will thus be completely described in terms of the physical. But that sentence will do justice to the fact that mental events cause other mental events to occur, and it will do justice to the precise way in which they do so. By saying that causal role fixes content, RS makes content too brittle: any deviations of any kind between any two mental states ipso facto amount to differences in content. No two mental entities have exactly the same causal roles. (There isn’t anything in your mind that has exactly the same causal role as my belief that 2 is an even prime. There isn’t anything in any person’s mind that has exactly the same causal role as anything in anyone else’s mind.) It follows that, if RS is right, no two...",

It must be stressed that you know there to be nothing about the game or about you that predisposed this to happen—that you know this to be entirely a matter of luck. Under these circumstances, it would be natural to predict that you’ll roll a 27 next time. But that prediction would be irrational: you have no more reason to believe that you’ll roll a 27 than you will any other number. And if, by chance, you do roll a 27 next time, it will be natural to predict that you’ll roll a 27 the following time. But this too would be completely irrational. So long as you know that there’s nothing inherent in the game or in yourself that favors this as opposed to that outcome, you are never any more entitled to bet that, with the next throw, you’ll roll a 27 than you are to bet that you’ll throw any other available number. It doesn’t matter how many consecutive 27s you rolled prior to that throw: it could have been ten, a thousand, or a million. By the same token, no matter how many consecutive 27s you roll, you are never any more entitled to bet that, next time, you won’t roll a 27 than you are to bet that you won’t roll any one of the other available numbers. It would be natural to think otherwise, of course. Given how improbable it is that you will roll five consecutive 27s, let alone 50, you may have an urge, when rolling for the 51st time, to think: “this time, surely, I’m even more unlikely to roll a 27 than I am to roll any other available number. The game isn’t rigged. The likelihood of my rolling 51 consecutive 27s is infinitesimal and, therefore, is much smaller than 1/n (where n is the number of available slots). So a 27-roll...",

People proverbially overestimate their ability to read others. And even if you are a good judge of character, so what? Anybody can be fooled; everybody is fooled, at some point or other. And if Larry is a career criminal—which, given his rap-sheet, he may well be—then he has probably honed his skills as a con-man. This doesn’t mean that E3 is completely innocuous. If correct, it raises the question of how somebody could seem so different from how they are. It also raises the question of how, despite being a crime expert, you could have been unwary enough to let yourself be seduced into trusting somebody who, given his background, was so obviously unworthy of trust. But these mysteries can be dealt with more easily than the mysteries created by E1–E2. All of this goes to show that ceteris paribus the best explanation is the one that leaves us with the fewest unexplained explainers. Of course, new theories raise questions of their own. This is almost a tautology. A new theory is, tautologously, a new way of looking at things; and a new way of looking things is, very obviously if not tautologously, one that raises new questions. But good new theories tend to facilitate the answering of the questions they raise. Relativity Theory raises questions that don’t arise for its predecessor, Newtonian mechanics.5 But Relativity Theory itself tends to contain hints as to how those questions are to be answered. The development of a good theory tends to consist largely in making explicit what is already present in that theory. The development of a bad theory consists in adding new material to it to help it deal with each new onslaught of counterevidence.6 In any case, what’s important in this context is that good theories get rid of causal gaps and they shrink the ones they can’t get rid of. Before proceeding, we must make a certain distinction very clear. Little or nothing about the actual causal structure of the world is analytic. It isn’t analytic that there aren’t giant causal gaps in the causal structure of the world; that reality doesn’t consist of one ex nihilo event after another, that superheroes don’t suddenly pop into existence, steal cars, and then, without leaving...",

And Gus doesn’t have some sort of psychic gift that would give him access to otherwise unknowable facts about the bus driver’s mind that would legitimize his explanation. Indeed, a belief that he has such a gift isn’t even among Gus’s many delusions. Nor does he have any good reason—even if, for argument’s sake, one allows his delusions and hallucinations to count as good reasons—to believe that he has such a gift. So given the entirety of the data at our disposal, Gus’s explanation is a bad one. The only evidence in favor of Gus’s theory is that the bus driver started smiling upon being given the money. But Gus is right. His explanation is correct down to the last detail. Given that it turned out to be correct, should we say that, despite first appearances, Gus’s explanation is not a bad one? No! It’s a datum that it’s bad. It’s a bad explanation that turned out to be correct. Thus, for an explanation to be a good one isn’t for it to be correct.

Step 3: One creates more unexplained explainers by assuming that the unknown differs from the known than by assuming that it does not. Step 4: If one remains agnostic—if one refuses to say, one way or the other, whether the unknown resembles the known—one is committed to the incoherent position that there’s no reason to prefer a hypothesis that creates few unexplained explainers to an otherwise comparable one that creates many. (The reason this view is incoherent is that for one explanation to be preferable to another just is for it to do more in the way of explaining, and thus less in the way of creating unexplained explainers, than the other.) Step 5: Given MC, and given Steps 1–4, it follows that there is an analytic and therefore non-inductive reason to hold that, other things being equal, the unknown resembles the known. Conclusion: Hume is wrong; Hume’s argument fails. This is a direct consequence of Step 5. Given the legitimacy of MC, it’s obvious why, though it may initially appear cautious and conservative, skepticism about the external world is actually an extravagant and irrational position. One’s sensory experience is replete with discontinuities. Every time you open your eyes or turn your head, you are flooded with sensory experiences that are totally unlike those that you were experiencing a moment earlier. According to the non-skeptic, these new experiences don’t come into existence ex nihilo; they are merely links in chains of events whose other links you don’t perceive. The skeptic says that it’s no more rational to believe this about our sensory experiences than it is to believe that those experiences come into existence ex nihilo. In saying this, the skeptic is saying, in effect, that it’s just as rational to accept a theory that creates more anomalies than it gets rid of than it is to accept an otherwise comparable theory that gets rid of more anomalies than it creates.

Mill (1806–1873), Rudolph Carnap (1891–1970), and W.V.O. Quine (1908–2000). In this chapter, we will find that empiricism is not in its strictest form a defensible doctrine and that, consequently, at least some knowledge has a non-perceptual basis. There are, as we will see, two important corollaries. First, many commonsense-based views about the internal (psychological) and external (physical) worlds must be jettisoned. Second, sober scientific methodology actually demands an acceptance of principles that would strike common sense as decidedly unscientific. We will see that many concepts that cannot be adequately understood along strictly empiricist lines can nonetheless be correctly understood only interms of what empiricism has to say about them.",

(i)–(iii) cannot be translated into statements that don’t presuppose or affirm the existence of properties. So it isn’t really an option to hold that properties don’t exist. As soon as one grants that anything resembles anything, one must grant that universals exist independently of thought. For two objects to be similar in some respect is for there to exist some property that they both have. For two objects to have the same shape is for there to exist some morphological property such that each object is an instance of that property. It’s obviously possible for two objects to have the same shape in a world devoid of sentient beings. Therefore, there exist properties in worlds where there are no sentient beings. Therefore, properties aren’t created by such beings and aren’t otherwise dependent on them. Properties are identical with categories. For x to fall into a given category is for x to have a given property. (For x to fall into the category of round things is for x to have the property of being round.) Given that properties exist independently of thought, the same is true of categories. Thus, contrary to what some empiricists (e.g., Locke) say, categories are not devices that human beings created in order to expedite thought.

A precondition for sense-perceiving anything is that we be able to represent it as having a location (relative to us) in space and time, that we be able to represent it as having a certain shape, state of motion, color, etc. Although we learn a great deal through perception, what we don’t learn through it are the concepts—space, time, motion, shape, color, etc.—out of which sense-perceptions are constructed. So those things, and all that having them involves, must be in the mind prior to sense-perception, as a necessary precondition for it. These considerations expose what I believe to be the deepest confusion of which empiricism is guilty. Empiricists fail to distinguish between two very different roles that sense-perceptions can have: they can have a triggering role and they can also have an information-transmitting role.",

(As a matter of typography, you can replace “1 + 1” with “2,” just as you can replace “five” with “5.”) And all the so-called “truths of reason” that lie outside of mathematics are thought to be explained in the same way. 1.1.1 Why (1) is wrongYour knowledge that 113 + 876 = 989 isn’t empirical; you didn’t see 113 pears being counted, then see 876 pineapples being counted, and then see the whole lot be counted. (And even if you did have such an experience in connection with those particular numbers, there are many other pairs of numbers whose sums—not to mention quotients, products, differences, etc.—you know, or could readily figure out, but in connection with which you’ve never seen anything like the situation just described.) Your knowledge of arithmetical truths is based on a grasp of non-empirical principles. Even if (what I think is necessarily false) you learned that 1 + 1 = 2 from watching one thing be put on top of another, you still would not, on that basis alone, have any way of generalizing that knowledge—of inferring the other mathematical truths you know. To make the needed inferences, you’d need access to rules of inference that you couldn’t possibly know about if your knowledge were strictly sense-based. Another reason why (1) is wrong: Even one’s knowledge that 1 + 1 = 2 isn’t known empirically. As David Hume made clear, observation tells you how things are, not how they should be. It reveals facts, not norms. But one’s knowledge that 1 + 1 = 2 has normative force. If two people enter what you thought was an empty house, and three people leave, you don’t reconsider your belief that 1 + 1 = 2. You take that belief as fixed and, in light of it, reconsider your belief that the house was in fact empty.

And they represent their objects in four dimensions, and as having various chromatic (color-related), kinematic (movement-related), dynamic (force-related, causal) properties. Unless we take the implausible view that no intelligence is involved in the processes mediating between the somatic disturbances that lead to sense-perceptions, on the one hand, and those sense-perceptions themselves, on the other, none of this would be possible unless your mind, at some level, had some kind of pre-perceptual understanding of what it is for two things to be spatially, dynamically, etc., interrelated. So, in all likelihood, sense-perception presupposes knowledge. 4.1 Why non-empirical knowledge is a prerequisite for post-perceptual, inferential knowledge We couldn’t do very much with the information that sense-perception gave us unless we had non-empirical knowledge. First of all, your senses operate in the present. You are not seeing, touching, etc., whatever you’re not now seeing, touching, etc. At most, you are remembering it. In order to apply what you remember to a current situation, you must see how what you remember bears on your current situation. Let’s take an example that, because it concerns such a pedestrian inference, shows how great the scope of this point is. You remember seeing somebody turn the key in their car and then driving away. You are now in front of a car with a key in it, and you want to drive it. Obviously you can apply what you remember to this situation. Let us suppose that you do so. So you think: “on that occasion, turning the key started the car; so the same thing will happen on this occasion. So, given that I want to start the car, I’ll turn the key.” Sense-perception (plus memory) has shown you that on the first occasion a certain car started after the key in it was turned. And, supposing that you turn the key in this car (the one in front of you), sense-perception will show you that another car started after the key in it was turned. But sense-perception did not show you, and could not possibly have shown you, that there was a relationship between these two situations; it could not show you that, because the car in the first situation started after the key was turned, the same would be true of the car in the second.

Nevertheless, knowing something always involves grasping at least one thing in some way other than through an image and, therefore, in some way that, because sense-perception gives one nothing but images, empiricism cannot account for. There’s a difference between an image, on the one hand, and that image’s being represented as true, on the other. (Philosophers use the word “veridical” to describe accurate perceptions, and they sometimes use the word “falsidical” to describe inaccurate ones. But I’ll stick with “true” and “false.”) Consider some painting (e.g., a painting of a woman picking flowers). There is nothing in the image itself that says: this woman really exists, and she realy is picking flowers. Images are not self-referential; so they don’t say “I am true” or “I am false.” Thus, the image itself leaves it open to how it is to be taken. It could be taken as something true, something false, or something that is not meant to be taken as true or as false. A corollary is that there is no image such that, merely by virtue of experiencing it, one is grasping the concept of truth. To know something, one must believe it to be true. Believing something to be true thus involves grasping the concept of truth and, given what we just said, therefore involves grasping something that cannot possibly be grasped by experiencing an image. Since the senses provide us only with images, it follows that the concept of truth is one that is not be grasped through the senses. And since a grasp of that concept is a prerequisite to knowing anything, it follows that, contrary to what empiricism says, not all knowledge is strictly sense-based. In fact, it follows that, although a great deal of knowledge is obviously largely sense-based, no knowledge is strictly sense-based.",

Some philosophers accept skepticism.5 But for Berkeley, skepticism is not alternative. He all but takes it for granted that it’s false. (We’ll say why in a moment.) This puts Berkeley between a rock and a hard place. Berkeley refuses to stop being an empiricist. And he also refuses to accept skepticism. This leaves him with only one option. He must show that the presumption that our senses give us knowledge of the external world can be accommodated within the limits set by the belief that all knowledge is strictly observational. There is only one way to do this. One must reinterpret statements about the external objects as statements about one’s own perceptions. In other words, one must take the view that the statement “that rock weighs five lbs” has the same content as some statement about one’s own perceptions. The position that statements about external objects can be translated into statements about perceptions is known as phenomenalism. Any attempt to translate a sentence about the external world into one about one’s perceptions is known as a phenomenal reduction. Phenomenalism entails idealism. If every truth about rocks, trees, etc., is a truth about perceptions, then rocks, trees, etc., are nothing if not perceptions. Phenomenalism is false. It simply isn’t possible to translate statements about rocks (etc.) into statements about one’s perceptions. We’ll see why in Section 8.0.

So it must be on the basis of some principle known to us through observation—supposing that it’s made on the basis of any principle at all. But all of the perceptions we’re talking about are equally credible. Remember that we’re setting aside dream-images, hallucinations, etc. We’re focusing only on garden-variety perceptions—those that, unless our senses are constantly deceiving us, must be correct. This entails, tautologically, that there is no observational-basis for deciding that some of the perceptions in question are to be thrown out while others are to be kept on. In other words, there is no observation-based principle on the basis of which we can decide which perceptions to keep on. And, since we’re empiricists, this means that there is no principle at all on the basis of which we decide which perceptions to keep on. So, given that we’re following Path #1, we must arbitrarily choose to throw out certain perceptions while keeping others. This means that, even if we made the right choices, we wouldn’t know it, since those choices weren’t justified.

Obviously (ii) is the right choice. You shouldn’t regard your heart rate as a periodic process. You should say that it’s your heart rate that’s changing, not the entire universe.10 Comparable points hold with respect to all degree properties. (By a “degree property,” I mean one that can be had to varying degrees. So coldness is a degree property, since one thing can be colder than another. But the property of being divisible by two is not, since a number either has that property or it doesn’t.) Suppose a consequence of taking object L to have a constant length is that, when L is put in a freezer, everything in the universe (except for L itself) expands and that, when x is put in boiling water, everything in the universe shrinks. In that case, obviously, you shouldn’t take L to have an unchanging length; you shouldn’t take it as your standard of comparison. The principle implicit in all this is that, if one learns that there has been a change in the difference between x and y in respect of how much they have degree property phi, one should regard the extent to which x has phi as having changed less than the degree to which y has phi if and only if doing so is less costly, from an explanatory viewpoint, than it would be to regard y as having undergone less change (in that respect) than y or to regard x and y as having undergone equal amounts of change (same qualification). So, if fewer causal anomalies are created by regarding y as having undergone less phi-change than x than are created by regarding x as having undergone more phi-change than y, then one should not regard x as approximating, to a higher degree than y, to a condition of phi-uniformity.

The problem with BA is that, contrary to what it says, your first house-perception is consistent with your second house-perception. The first perception doesn’t say that the house is big. It tells you how its size compares with those of various objects. It tells you that it’s shorter than the telephone pole next to it, but taller than the cactus in front of it, etc. The comparative information given to you by your second perception is consistent with it. The relative apparent sizes of the cactus, house, and telephone pole are the same. In the second perception, the house appears the way that small things appear when looked at from up close. And that is the one and only sense in which the house “looks small.” But you’re not looking at the house from up close. You’re looking at it from far away. And your perception isn’t telling you that the house is close by and looks that way. It’s telling you that you’re far away from the house and it looks that way. So it isn’t telling you that the house is small. It’s actually telling you that it’s quite big.",

When you’re far from the house, your field of vision has to include a great many objects other than the house. So it doesn’t eat up very much map-space. Thus, measured in terms of how much map-space they eat up, the first house-image is larger than the second house- image. But that doesn’t mean that those perceptions make different statements concerning the size of the house. On a map the size of a postage stamp, the discoloration that represents Denmark will be miniscule. On a map the size of the side of a big house, the corresponding discoloration will be much bigger. But that doesn’t mean that Denmark is small according to the small map and big according to the big one. Each of those maps tells you that Denmark’s actual size corresponds to the relative, not the absolute, size of the picture of Denmark on that map. The bigger that discoloration is in relation to the other nation-representations on that map, the bigger the size thereby attributed to Denmark. Thus, the size attributed to Denmark by the small map might be twice that attributed to it by the big map. The same thing mutatis mutandis is true of visual images. A big house no more “looks small” when looked at from far away is identical than Denmark “looks small” on the tiny map. When the house is looked at from far away, the corresponding house-image is small (i.e., it eats up a comparatively small amount of visual space).

But it isn’t subjective in the same way as my prejudice-driven fear of people who wear plaid shirts. Bearing this in mind, suppose that, all of a sudden, the way things smelled was no indication as to whether they were rotten or not. So, for example, a putrid-smelling cut of meat might or might not be good to eat—its smell would give you no information as to its fitness as a source of nourishment—the same being true of a wholesome-smelling cut of meat. In general, we wouldn’t know anything about an object’s causal properties from the way it smelled. But we often know a lot about a thing’s causal properties from the way it smells. Smells correlate extremely reliably with certain causal features of objects—sometimes much more reliably than other properties. Sometimes the way thing smells is the only indication (short of eating it or sending it to a toxicology lab) that it’s laced with poison or that it’s completely rotten. Smells track primary properties; they track facts about microstructure that would otherwise be hard to detect. If a police-detective suspects that X is pure cocaine, he can verify his hypothesis by (i) snorting X, which would have various adverse consequences, (ii) sending X to a forensics laboratory, which would be extremely slow, or (iii) tasting it, which would be quick and easy. A relevant fact about method (ii) is that many scientific techniques would have been impossible to develop had there not been reliable correlations between microstructure and odor. This is true of secondary properties generally. There are some apparent counterexamples to our contention that secondary properties track microstructure. For example, a thing’s color doesn’t correlate reliably with its microstructure. From far away, the ocean water looks black; from up close it’s transparent. Locke concluded from this that secondary properties are subjective. But this is not the only conclusion to draw. An object’s apparent color is a function both of that object’s microstructure and of the relevant observer’s physical relation to that object. But so does an object’s apparent shape, apparent size, smell, etc. So the variability of apparent color no more entails the subjectivity of color than does the variability of apparent shape. And so long as the conditions of observation are held constant, an object’s apparent color does reliably...",

But, duly scrutinized, it turns out to entail that olfaction is, like vision and audition, does give us such knowledge. Much of the knowledge that we acquire through the sense of smell is based on the comparative properties of our olfactory sensations. Other things being equal, the more rotten a cut of meat is, the worse it smells. Other things being equal, the more pungent the fragrance of a eucalyptus tree is, the richer that tree is in the chemical responsible for that smell. Bearing this in mind, suppose that S is the exact smell had (under a given set of circumstances) by a cut of meet that was rotten to degree n, and that S* is the fragrance (same qualification) of a eucalyptus having amount m of the relevant chemical. Because the previously described exchange hasn’t occurred, given a cut of meat having S and some other, otherwise observationally identical cut of meat, with a much stronger (weaker) version of S, I know on that basis that ceteris paribus the latter cut of meat is more (less) rotten than the former. For this reason, if the exchanged in question occurred but that other, compensatory changes didn’t occur alongside t i , our ability to acquire comparative knowledge of this kind would be diminished. But there’s no reason why any given set of causal properties should be associated with any given type of olfactory sensation. What is necessary is that, once the assignments are made, their mutual relations parallel the mutual relations of their objects. (SA17) So you admit that its having this as opposed to that odor does not, in and of itself, diminish our ability to learn about the world through the sense of smell. You admit, in other words, that rotten meat doesn’t have to have the smell it does. But in admitting this, you’re admitting that it doesn’t really have that smell. There are two problems with SA. Problem #1: When we say that a given cut of meat has a bad smell, we’re talking about the cut of meat. If the word “smell” referred to sensations, then sentences like “that meat has an awful smell” wouldn’t be about the meat. By the same token, so far as that sentence is about the meat, it isn’t about sensations. Thus, to the...",

He was wrong about (ii), as we saw a few pages ago. But he was right about (i). There is no one microstructure that Rover must have if my current perception of him is to be accurate.

We know how heavy/hot/big/etc., a thing is only to the extent that we know how much heavier/hotter/bigger/etc., that thing is than some other thing. Spatiotemporal knowledge is comparative knowledge. That means that anything—no matter what it’s parts are ‘made of’—whose parts are appropriately interrelated is no more, and no less, consistent with what our sense-perceptions tell us than is any other thing whose parts are thus interrelated.

(We’ll refer to that light beam as “L.”) As a result of that collision, L’s structure changed in such a way that R’s structure is now coded in it’s (L’s) structure. For this reason, L bears information about R. L hits your eyes, disturbing them. Those disturbances reflect L’s structure. Given that L reflects R’s structure, it follows that these disturbances of your eyes reflect R’s structure. Those ocular disturbances therefore encode information about R. The resulting neural impulses transmit this information to some part of you that decodes this information. The results of this decoding are embodied in a visual perception that succeeds in representing R. Light is energy. Things change when bombarded by energy. They don’t always change very much. But there is always some change. It takes time for light, or any other information-bearing process, to travel. So by the time L reaches your eyes, some time has elapsed. During the time that has elapsed, the changes in R that were initiated by L led to other changes in R. Since, for the time being, L is your only source of information about R, and since L gives you dated and otherwise inaccurate information about R, the information encoded in the visual perception that L caused you to have is itself inaccurate. Before we take the next step, I’d like to clarify this point. Let t be the time that you have the visual perception of R that L caused you to have. Obviously t will happen after the time L hits your eyes and t is later than the time that L collided with R. During the time between that collision, on the one hand, and t, on the other, R has changed. Why has it changed? Because the just-mentioned collision made it change. That collision, as we just pointed out, set off processes because of which R changed. What you know, at t, about R is confined to what L tells you.

A correct guess, perhaps. Some guesses are lucky guesses. But lucky guesses aren’t knowledge. (See Chapter 10 for an explanation of this.) If it’s said that the laws of logic don’t apply to God, I would say: “yes they do.” If, in response to that, it’s said that God, being omnipotent, can’t be hemmed in by anything, even the laws of logic, I would reply by saying that this statement embodies a total failure to understand the nature of logical truth—that God’s inability to create a square circle is no more an abridgment of Her powers than an athlete’s “inability” to score a touchdown in a soccer match shows a lack of athletic talent. If asked why, I can only say: read Chapter 25, Section 4, which is dedicated to this problem. In any case, the idea God could know of some event without having any causal connection is in the same category as the idea that a sufficiently good athlete could score a touchdown in the course of a soccer match. It’s simply incoherent. But why exactly is it incoherent? Only justified true beliefs are knowledge. Lucky guesses don’t count. A justified belief is one for which there is evidence. One spatiotemporal thing is evidence of another if and only if the first is causally related to the second in such a way that, given the existence of the first, that of the second can be inferred. Therefore, one’s own mental states are evidence of a given external thing, and therefore give one a justification for believing that thing to exist, only if those mental states are effects of that thing. So the idea that God could know of some spatiotemporal entity without being causally connected to that entity is no more coherent than the abject absurdity that one event could be evidence of another even though the occurrence of the first event provided no reason to suspect the occurrence of the second.

Nonetheless, he makes this choice. It just comes out of the blue. Was this choice made freely? It doesn’t seem like it. It actually seems rather compulsive—like something that just overcame Smith. Suppose that “choices” similar to the one just described were a frequent occurrence in Smith’s psychological life. Would we say that Smith was “free”? No. We’d describe him as having a kind of disorder. We’d describe the fact that he was visited by these strange compulsions as indicative of a lack of psychological integrity on his part; and see his submission to these forces as showing a lack of freedom on his part. Smith is a puppet dancing at the end of strings pulled by psychopathology. This suggests that, in order to be made “freely,” a choice has to be rooted in facts about one’s personality, and must express one’s values, desires, beliefs, and previous intentions. A choice that lacks these roots seems to involve a disintegration of the person’s psyche and, paradoxical though this may seem, a consequent diminution of the subject’s freedom. So even if there is indeterminism, it doesn’t help people be free; indeterminism actually seems to hurt our chances of being free. But to the extent that a choice is appropriately rooted in a person’s personality, that choice is not the result of indeterminism but, on the contrary, of a deterministic structure.

Even though: (JFK) “if JFK hadn’t been assassinated, he would have been re-elected” is a plausible counterfactual, it isn’t necessarily true. What if, sometime after Nov. 22, 1963, but before the ‘64 elections, JFK died of natural causes or was disgraced by some scandal? In that case, he would not have been re-elected. So the right counterfactual is: (JFK*) “if JFK hadn’t been assassinated, then ceteris paribus he would have been re-elected.” In other words, if JFK hadn’t been assassinated, but otherwise e things were the same, so that JFK was healthy and popular, etc., then he would have been re-elected. Notice that JFK* is really a causal claim, since it’s just another way of saying: (JFK#) “JFK’s being assassinated caused an otherwise re-election-bound JFK to not be re-elected.” As a rule, counterfactuals are causal claims.10 Thus, “Smith killed Jones freely” is true just in case (i) Smith killed Jones and (ii) if Smith had chosen not to kill Jones, then ceteris paribus Smith would have not killed Jones.

If he had no desire to leave the room, then his freedom would not be limited by his inability to leave the room. In general, it is only relative to the choices that we make that our freedom is limited. So there can be a lack of freedom only where choices have already been made. Since, consequently, the making of choices must occur before there can be any lack of freedom, it follows that our choices themselves are made freely. (Cf. Merleau-Ponty, p. 469: “[W]hat are called obstacles to freedom are in reality deployed by it. An unclimbable rock face, a large or small slanting rock, are things which have no meaning for anyone who is not intending to surmount them...” See also Sartre, p. 463.) Given a Lockean conception of freedom (“to be free is to be able to do what you want to do—nothing more”) SMP2 goes through. So SMPT is conditionally correct. But on the basis of it, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty hold a view that is unconditionally incorrect. They hold that, given the truth of (SMP2), it follows that choices are entirely uncaused.18 This is a major non-sequitur. It may be true that one cannot meaningfully speak of an absence of freedom except where choices have already been made.

But it’s a distinct possibility that, depending on the mathematician, the mechanisms that make that possible are considerably reinforced by mechanisms the very purpose of which, at least when they were first developed, was to narrow the individual’s psyche, so as to cast intolerable conceits into the abyss of the unconscious. It should be pointed out that mechanisms whose original purpose is neurotic can end up becoming non-neurotic virtues of character. For example, to deal with some specific problem (e.g., a sense of helplessness that is induced by an unstable home-life), a given person might over-develop some existing character trait (e.g., tendency to focus on details becomes a maniacal obsessions with them), which, after the initial disturbance, has been dealt with, assumes some non-pathological, adaptive form (e.g., a talent for neurosurgery). Basically, there isn’t always a clear distinction between mental illness and mental hyper-wellness. And the fact that the border is blurry isn’t to be understood in terms of the trivial, ubiquitous fact that most borders are blurry (that, for example, there is no sharp line between short and tall, poor and rich, etc.). The blurring of the line, where mental illness is concerned, has to do with the fact such illness is, in some ways, at certain junctures, constitutive of certain kinds of mental health (or, what may be different, mental flourishing). This, I think, is why “genius” and “madness” are proverbially thought to go together. I don’t think that the two, in fact, go together. Madness is always performance-inhibiting, for reasons that we’ll soon discuss. But the eccentricities associated with ego-dystonic ailments are often conflated with madness, leading to the false view that insanity is associated in some way with genius. I must emphasize that ego-dystonic ailments are not a form of madness. (Not all psychological disturbances are forms of madness.) So far as the word “madness” has a clear meaning, it refers to a condition in which one identifies with one’s pathologies—it refers to ego-syn-tonic ailments. A precondition for such conditions is a lowering of inhibitions that, in sane people, remain operative and that, when hyper-operative, constitute OCD and other ego-dystonic ailments.

(Smith doesn’t know about the microchip or about Jones.) But Jones seldom uses his power to control Smith. So usually Smith is just like the rest of us—he does what he wants (so far as anyone does), and he does it freely (same qualification). Smith is perfectly sane and, when Jones isn’t controlling his behavior, his actions are free (so far as anyone’s actions are ever free). Smith intends to kill Green. By coincidence, Jones also wants Green dead. Moreover, Jones also knows of Smith’s intention. If, at the last moment, Smith decides not to kill Green, Jones will use the microchip to make Smith kill Green. As it happens, Smith goes through with it on his own, and Jones doesn’t have to use the microchip. Assume that, in killing Green, Smith’s mental state is like that of a person who acts “freely” (whatever that means)—it’s like your mental state when you buy a candy bar.

X, having just been made out of refrigerator-stored ingredients, is nice and cool. Y, having been sitting on the counter for two hours is warm and yucky. Given how different X and Y are, what sense can it make to say that they are identical? Here we have to take a brief detour through a bit of physics and metaphysics. X is not a simple entity. It has various parts—it consists of two slices of bread, a leaf of lettuce, etc. But each of those parts consists, ultimately, of a vast swarm of incessant displacements of mass-energy. Given any macroscopic physical object—a rock, a bar of soap, a plant—not a single micro-constituent of that object will stay in the same place for any amount of time. Given any one of the atoms composing any macroscopic object, that atom will move (it will rotate, vibrate, and altogether change its location) if you give it so much as a trillionth of a second. And all the objects that we deal with in everyday life—our cars, our clothes, our toothbrushes—are composed of these incessant movements of microparticles. So, really, all of those objects are collections of events. The seeming changelessness of the poster on your wall is an illusion: at any given time, that poster consists of nothing but movements and exchanges of mass and energy. We must make two final points before we can say what (*) means. First, in some cases, events are causally related to one another, and in some cases they’re not. I brushed my teeth this morning and you put on your shoes. The one event didn’t cause the other. But my brushing my teeth did cause various particles on my teeth to dissolve or change location. When events are causally related to each other, they satisfy one of two conditions: either they are adjacent in both space and time or, if they are not adjacent, they are connected by a series of events each of whose links is adjacent with at least one other event in that same series. The event of my dragging the toothbrush across the bit of cereal stuck to my tooth occupied the same approximate place as the event of the bit of cereal’s...",

Question: is the new rock numerically identical with the one you vaporized? In other words, is it the very same rock? Or, instead, is it a distinct rock that is extremely similar to the old one? Answer: it’s a distinct rock that’s very similar to the old one. They are, apart from their spatiotemporal properties, qualitatively but not numerically identical. Another, similar story will reinforce this conclusion. Rock R is vaporized—but not by a human or anything else that can act deliberately. The blind, uncaring hand of nature is what does the vaporizing. R’s atoms are dispersed through the cosmos. But, by some extraordinary coincidence, they all reconvene a million years later and they attach themselves to one another, thereby forming a new rock. Let R* be this new rock. Of course, R* consists of exactly the same particles as R. Moreover, R*’s structure is exactly like R’s. Finally, each of the atoms composing R* has exactly the same role within R*’s structure that it had within R’s structure.

The blobby infant has the property of being-preverbal-in-1973 and so do I.4 Therefore, the fact that, unlike my six month old self, I am not now a blobby infant, being instead a non-blobby professor, does not make me different from my six month old self. Given any other property that I now have that I used to lack, or vice versa, a similar argument shows that I have always had that property. For this reason, it is said, Leibniz’s Law does govern diachronic uses of expressions like “identity,” “is” (in the non-predicative sense), and so on. In addition to being obviously contrived, this view has the absurd consequence that nothing changes. Whatever properties I have now, I’ve always had then and always will have them. In general, nothing acquires properties. It follows that nothing ever loses a property. When a person acquires the property of being able to tie his shoes, he loses the property of being incapable of tying his shoes. In general, any case of property-acquisition is a case of property-loss. So if nothing ever acquires properties, nothing changes. Given that there is change, the no-change must be false. In any case, we obviously don’t yet know that the no-change view is the right one. So were we to build a theory of identity around that view, we’d be prejudging the outcome of the debate between those who accept that view and those who reject it. Good analyses tend not to prejudge open questions; and when good analyses do prejudge such questions, they tend to prejudge them in a way that is favorable to deeply rooted intuitions. The view that nothing changes is not exactly a deeply rooted intuition. So for the time being we must regard all this talk of time-indexing as nothing more than hollow trickery. To move forward, we must say a word about the debate that rages between those who accept a doctrine known as “four-dimensionalism” (henceforth, “4-D”) and those who reject that doctrine. According to 4-D, any given object is identical with a “space-time worm.” A space-time worm is an entity that is spread out in both space and time. Thus, according to 4-D, you are identical with a space-time worm that comprises all of the events and states of affairs constituting you from the moment of your birth (or...",

And we’ll see in the upcoming section that 4-D is correct only if (i) there is retroactive causation and (ii) instances of retroactive causation have absolutely no effects on anything. Each of (i) is and (ii) is a hideous assault on logic. Should it turn out that 4-D does have these consequences, there would be no good reason to accept it. In any case, assuming that things change, the only way to go is to say that identity, in the diachronic sense, is to be understood in terms of relations of causal connectedness—that statements like “Bill is the guy in the photo who is wearing a rugby shirt” are to be analyzed in the way described earlier. Since the relevant sort of connectedness obviously comes in degrees, so does identity. It should be pointed out that David Hume (1711–1776), whose views we’ll discuss in Section 6.0, takes a similar view, and so does Derek Parfit (1942-).6 Finally, it should be pointed out that those who reject this view are reading metaphysics off of sentential surface structure. The expressions we use to denote the relation of diachronic identity (e.g. “is” and “is identical with”) are homonyms of the expressions we use to denote the relation of synchronic identity. Given only that fact, along with some obscure and ambiguous intuitions about selfhood, 4-dimensionalists infer synchronic identity is diachronic identity—that, when I say “I am identical with the infant in the picture,” the relation I am alleging to hold between myself and that blobby infant is identical with the relation that I am alleging to hold between four and the square of two when I say “22=4.” That inference is completely spurious; and it’s one that no self-respecting analytic philosopher would make, given that the essence of analytic philosophy is a stubborn refusal to take surface structure to be a foolproof guide to truth. We’ll now discuss why 4-D entails (i) and (ii).",

Since it’s a datum that X2 and X3, being in different places, are distinct from each other, it follows that, just as Lewis says, the mind and body had by X1, prior to the split, were shared by X2 and X3. It follows, in other words, that X1, X2, and X3 were there all along, all rolled into one package. Given how preposterous that is, it’s clear what we must say. X2 is “identical” with X1 in the sense that it is X1’ s successor; the same is true of X3. And the same thing mutatis mutandis is therefore true of you. You are identical with your teen self in the sense that you are that entity’s successor.

Human beings don’t want to believe that they are event-sequences that can become frayed, like an old rope, and dwindle into nothingness. Human beings don’t want to believe that their identities are internal to emotion-driven narratives. But what we want to believe is irrelevant.

In actuality, they are questions of logic, not of empirical fact. Moreover, each of (a)–(c) is logically false and therefore couldn’t possibly be correct. Let’s discuss (a) first. In this chapter, we have seen that anything that persists for any amount of time is a causal series (a continuous series of states of affairs such that, given any two of them, one is the (in)direct cause of the other). An illustration may be helpful. At any given moment during its existence, your car consists of an incessant flurry of mass-energy displacements; and your car is thus a series of “event-flurries,” as we’ll call them. Twenty-four hours ago, your car was constituted by one event-flurry. Right now it’s constituted by a different event-flurry. (Let S1 be the first event-flurry and let S2 be the second.) And, of course, my car is currently constituted by some event-flurry. (Let S3 be that flurry.) Bearing all of this in mind, imagine the following. While your car was parked in your driveway, somebody crashed into it, severely damaging it. Your car therefore bears little resemblance to what it was twenty-four hours ago. It follows that S1 and S2 are qualitatively very different from each other. By contrast, S1 and S3 are as similar to each other as their being in different places permits. This is sheer coincidence: S1 and S3 are, we will suppose, as causally disconnected from each other as any two non-simultaneous events on this planet can be. It follows that my car, as it is right now, is just like your car, as it was twenty-four hours ago, before it was damaged. It also follows that S1 is much less similar to S2 than it is to S3. Be all of this as it may, the car in your driveway is, whereas the car in my driveway is not, numerically identical with the car you owned twenty-four hours ago. Mediating between S1 and S2 is a continuous series of events such that, given any two of them, one is the (in)direct cause of the other. No such series mediates between S1 and S3.

If he’s next to some one tree during that entire period, he’s no more time-traveling than that tree. If he’s going from place to place, he’s no more time-traveling than any one of the satellites that will orbit the earth during that period.12 So depending on whether he’s somewhere or nowhere, Smith is either permanently annihilated in 2009 or he’s no more time-traveling than anything else that exists during that period. Therefore, (a) is false. To see why (b) is false, we need do little more than repeat some of the points just made. Suppose that Smith travels from 2009 to 2023 at a rate of one million minutes/minute. We’ve just seen that Smith cannot make this journey in a discontinuous manner; he cannot disappear from one time and reappear at some other, non-adjacent time. So Smith must make this journey in a continuous manner. So at any given moment during this interval, Smith must be in some place or other. It follows, as we saw a moment ago, that he is no more time-traveling than anything else that exists during that interval. The supposition that Smith is traveling forward in time at a rate of one million minutes/minute thus turns out to collapse into the supposition that he isn’t time-traveling at all. Given any positive number n, an analogous argument shows that continuous forward time-travel at a rate of n minutes/minute collapses into forward time-travel at a rate of one minute/minute. There is another, quite different problem with the concept of discontinuous time-travel. Let W1 be a universe where (i) is true and (ii) is false; and let W2 be an otherwise indistinguishable universe where (ii) is true and (i) is false. What happens in the one universe at any given time coincides with what happens in the other universe at that time. It follows that, even if (per impossibile) an occupant of the one universe knew exactly what happened in that universe at any given time, he would not, in virtue of that fact, have any legitimate reason for preferring (i) to (ii).

Echoing what we said earlier, there is no conceivable event that, were it known, would enable one to determine whether one was in W3 as opposed to W3, or vice versa. Which, taken together with the fact that being annihilated in 1985 didn’t exactly tighten young Marty’s grip on existence, suggests that, other things being equal, (2) is the better way to model the observational data. There is another, even deeper issue. For there to be backwards time-travel of any kind, there must be back retroactive causation: some events must be the effects of later events. Marty McFly’s appearing in 1955 must be an effect of some event occurring in 1985. But there are empirical and also strictly logical reasons for thinking backwards time-travel an impossibility. If Relativity Theory (RT) is right, which we’ll henceforth assume that it is, the statement “E2 is an effect of E1, but E1 post-dates E2” is tautologically false. According to RT, order in time is defined in terms of causation: anything caused by a given event ipso facto follows that event. Thus, the view that one could travel backwards in time is in the same category as the view that triangles could have five sides. A well known consequence of RT is that a given event may precede one event relative to one framework, be simultaneous with it relative to some second framework, and follow it relative to some third framework. Some conclude from this that backwards time-travel is possible. This is not the right inference to draw. For reasons that aren’t important here, the framework-relative nature of temporal order is a consequence of, among other things, the fact that any effect of an event ipso facto follows that event. In other words, it’s a consequence of the fact that “E2 precedes E1 and is also an effect ofit” is tautologically false. Like any other scientific theory, RT is empirical.

Nonetheless, it wouldn’t be in virtue of its being a closed three-sided (etc.) figure that x was green—it would be in virtue of its having certain reflective properties. And it wouldn’t be in virtue of its having those reflective properties that x was triangular—it would be in virtue of its being a three-sided, straight-edged (etc.) figure. This shows that the meaning of (B) is (C). When occurring in statements affirming logical (as opposed to causal) dependencies, “in virtue of” denotes a relationship holding, not between things or even facts, but between propositions. Given that the occurrence in (A) of “by virtue of” does denote a relationship holding between states of affairs, what are we to say? One response, of course, is to say that it’s ambiguous. But, in addition to appearing very wrong, this response is unnecessary. (A) doesn’t express an entailment. But it does express a dependence-relation holding between statements. The truth of Smith won the argument is, in this context, dependent on the truth of Smith bullied his opponent. In general, “in virtue of,” when occurring in causal contexts, can be interpreted as denoting a form of interpropositional dependence; and we may therefore condense (i) and (ii) into (iii) Dependence-relations hold between propositions, as opposed to things.",

Of course, functionalism is consistent with, and in fact depends on, the presumption that the brain-states that mediate mental states have causal powers. But since functionalism is inconsistent with the fact that in virtue of being mental states, brain-states are powerless, functionalism amounts to the denial that the mental (qua mental) has any causal powers at all. Given the fact that anything spatiotemporal ipso facto has causal powers, the reason being that occupancy of a time or a place is a form of causality, it follows that functionalism denies the very existence of minds. According to a doctrine known as “content-externalism,” two people, Smith and Twin-Smith, who are exactly the same, leaving aside the remote causes of their current conditions, can have thoughts with different contents. So, because Smith’s current visual perception was caused by light that bounced of Mary, whereas Twin-Smith’s current visual perception was caused by light that bounced off of Twin-Mary, otherwise identical Smith and Twin-Smith are now having thoughts with different truth-conditions and, therefore, different contents. (Smith is thinking that person—viz. Sally—is tall. Twin-Smith is thinking that person—viz. Twin-Sally—is tall.) To appreciate just what the content-externalist says, we must distinguish causal from constitutive necessity. Obviously people have different thoughts. And obviously differences in people’s personal pasts create many of the cognitive divergences between them. But the content-externalist is saying that, given two people who, like Smith and Twin-Smith, are now atom-for-atom duplicates of each other, and whose respective pasts haven’t so much as made a dent in the one person that they haven’t made in the other, those two people will think different things. They’ll have thoughts with different contents. One of them will think about Sally (gold, water, etc.), while the other thinks about Twin-Sally (fool’s Gold, etc.) This view is incoherent. If Smith and Twin-Smith were to switch places, but everything else were held constant, neither would behave or think differently from how he would otherwise do so. Thus, to the extent that Smith’s mental content is fixed by factors that aren’t operative in Twin-Smith’s case, Smith’s thinking isn’t at all different from Twin-Smith’s. Any differences between Smith’s and Twin-Smith’s thoughts have some basis other than the differences in their distal causes. So to the extent...",

Only a small part of the surface of the rock came into contact with the window—and, in fact, those parts of the rock’s surface came into contact with specific parts of one of the window’s two surfaces. Had the events at those contact points happened, the effect on the window would have been the same, even if no rock had struck the window. But if we say that (i)–(iii) are just wrong, our grounds being that a “cause” of an event E can only be an event that is directly responsible for E’s occurrence, then just about every single causal statement anyone makes will be wrong. But statements like (i)–(iii) obviously convey valuable information. So rather than say that they’re all just wrong, we should look for an interpretation of the word “cause” that validates those statements. Jackson and Petit have done just that. The form of causality mentioned in (i)–(iii) is program-causality. x is a program-cause of y if x consists of events that, in their turn, are directly responsible for y. A country’s being poor consists of various specific states of affairs—various specific people being without funds in various specific situations. The specific situations that constitute a condition of wide-spread poverty will directly cause crimes. And so on. F heats up the pan in the sense that among the events constitutive of F are those that heat up the pan; and it is in the same sense mutatis mutandis that the impact of the rock shattered the window. Thus, Jackson and Pettit have successfully validated ordinarily causal statements. They make other important points.

So the macro-story—or, rather, the various different macro-stories—aren’t inferior versions of the micro-story; they aren’t precursors to it that we’ll chuck when we have it. They expose regularities, structures, and counterfactual truths omitted by the micro-story. This shows that biology isn’t just bad physics, that psychology isn’t just bad physiology—it shows that different disciplines are dealing with different program-causes, and therefore distinct and very possibly sui generis nomic connections—that happen at least sometimes to be instantiated by the same efficient (micro) causes. Predictions are almost always made on the basis of a knowledge of program-causes. To predict what’s going to happen, one must know of structures that can be depended on to yield certain outputs, given certain inputs. So far as one lacks such knowledge, one must make predictions on an ad hoc basis, and there are two reasons why this is a problem. First, sub-structural facts tend to be small—literally small. (Something is a structure only to the extent that it’s a cohesive aggregate of events. Something fails to be a structure only to the extent that it’s an isolated event. Thus, lone events tend to be smaller than structures by orders of magnitude.8) And when they can be known, the process of learning about them tends to disrupt them in prediction-foiling ways. (See Chapter 14.) Also, structures comprise back-up mechanisms that ensure a certain outcome even if, because of some hidden variable, some rogue, structure-unfriendly event makes it through the gauntlet. If a salesperson working for megacorporation X unexpectedly quits, another takes his place. If one police officer doesn’t report for duty, another steps into the breach. It’s of the essence of structures that a certan amount of causal redundancy be incorporated into them. Where there isn’t such redundancy, predictions are easily foiled, since there is nothing to absorb the ripple-effects created by some rogue occurrence. Given the dependence of predictive knowledge on structures and, therefore, on program-causes, it follows that knowledge of explanations is comparably dependent. The reason is that explanation is reverse-prediction. One predicts X when one identifies current conditions that, given known mechanisms, make X’s occurrence likely. One explains X when one identifies past conditions that, given known mechanisms, resulted in X’s occurrence. The concept of a program-cause, which was, so far as I know, first clearly analyzed by Pettit and Jackson, is therefore central to the concepts of prediction and explanation...",

A consequence is that spatiotemporal positions exist independently of the events that might (or might not) occupy them. Spatiotemporal relations holding among events are to be understood in terms of spatiotemporal relations holding among positions in space-time. This means that there are absolute positions in space-time. If this view is right, it does make sense to say that one event just precedes some other event, or that one event just happens to be equidistant between two other events, and so on.15 Bearing these points in mind, consider the statement that: (IP16) x immediately precedes and is adjacent with y, and suppose IP to be true. If the first view is the right one, there are no event-independent positions. In that case, x’s being adjacent with y is a relation that holds directly between x and y, and to say that some position bears a certain relation to another position is to say that some event bears a certain relation to some other event. If the second view is the right one, the fact described by IP consists in x’s occupying some position that bears a certain relation to a position that is, in turn, occupied by y. In other words, it is only because the positions they occupy are adjacent that x and y are adjacent. Thus, the second view presupposes that there are event-independent, and thus absolute, spatiotemporal positions.

So even if CF is extensionally correct, it’s no analysis of the concept of causality. 6.1.2 The vicious circularity of CF, and an outline of a positive analysis of counterfactual truth CF assumes that the concept of counterfactual truth is not itself to be explained in terms of the concept of causality. But that may well be false. The statement: (SB) If Smith hadn’t fallen off the building, he wouldn’t have died seems to be equivalent, or nearly so, with: (SB*) Falling off the building caused an otherwise unthreatened Smith to die. Not all counterfactuals register causal facts. For example: (SH) If 6-feet tall Smith were half his current height, he’d be 3-feet tall, is equivalent, or nearly so, with (SH*) Smith is 6-feet tall entails anything that is 3-feet tall is half Smith’s height. Notice that SH is analytically true, whereas SB is non-analytically true. It thus seems to me that counterfactuals are just disguised causal or logical assertions and that, consequently, alternative worlds have no place in any decent analysis of them. In any case, these cases provide us with evidence that counterfactual truth is itself to be understood in terms of causality and, therefore, that CF is guilty of vicious circularity.",

If, in W*, Smith’s hand just seizes up, then there will be at least one other world—call it W#—such that W# is just like W* except that, in W#, Smith’s hand didn’t seize up or, if it did, something else happened that led to Jones being killed. In which case, LASK will be false. For, contrary to what LASK says, there would be a world satisfying the relevant conditions in which Jones dies. It’s not a good idea, in general, to posit causal slack in the worlds we want to validate our counterfactuals, since that same policy makes those very worlds unreliable in the way of validating our counterfactuals. Lewis’ own way of dealing with the problem is different from those just considered. In his view, some miracle happens in W* that prevents E from occurring there. So even though the natural laws in W* demand that E happen there (or, at any rate, demand it no less than the laws of our world demand it here), a “miracle” suspends these laws, and Jones lives. Lewis is saying that, if a world validates LASK, there is some miracle in it (at a certain time, in a certain place). So W*, by virtue of being able to validate LASK, also validates the following counterfactual: (MLASK) If Smith had not shot Jones, then a miracle would have happened. W* is, by hypothesis, a world where Smith doesn’t shoot Jones but is otherwise maximally like our world. In W*, there’s a miracle (at a certain time and a certain place). So W* makes MLASK true if it makes LASK true. But MLASK isn’t a true counterfactual. And, of course, if a miracle is needed to validate MLASK, then a miracle will be needed to validate any counterfactual.

It is only if that word is taken in some totally atemporal sense that WB comes out true. But, thus taken, WB says only that nine out of 10 balls in the urn are white if nine out of them are white. In general, when words like “probable” (and “probability,” etc.) refer to statistical probability, they must be taken in a strictly non-temporal sense. The statement: (*) given that, at time t, there are 10 apples in the barrel and only three oranges (and no other objects), your chances at time t* of selecting an orange are 3 in 13 is false. What is true is: (*1) given that, at time t, there are 10 apples in the barrel and only three oranges (and no other objects), you’re chances at time t of selecting an orange are 3 in 13, but only if the term “selecting” is used metaphorically. More precisely, (*1) is true only if it coincides with the trivial claim that, if 3 out of the 13 objects in the barrel is an orange, the ratio at that time of oranges to non-oranges is 3 to 13. Of course, even a Humean can grant the truth of trivial probability statements, such as (*). So if, by some remote chance, it could be shown that non-trivial probability statements (e.g., given that, in the past, all metal has expanded when heated, it will probably continue to do so) could be identified with trivial ones, the Humean would be able to accommodate the presumption, so crucial to thought and scientific explanation, that non-trivial probability statements are correct.

Statistical improbability is innocuous. It’s explanatory improbability that you have to worry about. But the explanatory probability of “x is green after 2010” dwarfs that of “x is grue after 2010” and, therefore, “x is blue after 2010.” The supposition that objects don’t change color (except under conditions that emeralds don’t satisfy, at least not in virtue of making it to 2010) is deeply embedded in scientific theory and also in the commonsense underpinning of scientific theory. If it’s wrong, then science is in serious trouble, and so is human knowledge in general. In response to this, it will be said that: If GA is right, emeralds that “turn blue” at the beginning of 2010 don’t change color. They stay the same color—grue. And emeralds that “stay green” do change color, since they go from being grue to having some other color. (Or, to be more precise, emeralds do change color at the beginning of 2010—but only relative to what one set of color-terms, these being green, red, etc. But emeralds stay the same color relative to different color terms—grue, bleen, etc.) This isn’t true. Pictures of green emeralds (taken before 2010) show them not to have the same color as blue things after 2010. Grueness and greenness are different properties. But they’re not different colors. Grueness isn’t a color at all—it’s a color-related property. Let’s say that x is a “squiangle” (rhymes with “triangle”) if it’s square-shaped before 2010 and triangle-shaped thereafter. If, for some reason, some object that was square before 2010 suddenly becomes a triangle, it’s obviously changed shape. It used to have four sides. Now it has three. And a “squiangular” object that is square-shaped after 2010 has started—in other words, an object that had four straight sides, etc., before 2010, and continued to have that shape—hasn’t changed shape; it hasn’t gone from being a “squiangle” to being a square.

Because, says Hempel, it doesn’t support counterfactuals. The statement: (ME) metal expands when heated expresses a law of nature because a piece of metal that isn’t being heated would expand if it were heated. Nothing comparable holds of YP. Given an arbitrary pencil, YP doesn’t entail that it would be yellow if it were on my desk. In general, says Hempel, laws are expressed by universal generalizations that support counterfactuals. Hempel is surely right that a statement must support counterfactuals if it is to express a natural law. But DN collapses if laws are understood in this way. Let m be some unheated metal object. Why is it that m would expand if it were heated? Because, the laws of nature being what they are, heating m would cause it to expand. So the fact that m would expand if heated is to be understood in terms of the fact that ME expresses a natural law. Remember what we said earlier about counterfactuals: they are thinly veiled causal statements. “Smith would be alive if he hadn’t jumped” means: “jumping is what caused the death of an otherwise unthreatened Smith.” So far as that causal claim is warranted, it is because there is known to be a law that, given the circumstances, demanded Smith’s death. The counterfactual claim is to be understood in terms of a causal claim, and the causal claim is to be understood in terms of a statement describing a natural law. DN thus becomes viciously circular if “law” is defined as “what is expressed by a counterfactual-supporting universal generalization.” Causal claims are themselves explanations.

If his position is to be free of such circularity, the advocate of DN must take laws to be mere concomitances. In his view, the law that all metal expands when heated is the regularity that, in the eyes of a non-Humean, merely expresses that law. In general, for the advocate of DN, laws are regularities—nothing more. But in that case, any true universal generalization expresses a law. YP (“everything is such that it’s either yellow or it isn’t a pencil on JMK’s desk”) describes a regularity. It correctly states that nothing has the property of being a pencil on JMK’s desk on March 11, 2009, unless it also has the property of being yellow. But it doesn’t express a law. If laws are identified with regularities, as opposed to the structures that (so non-Humeans think) underlie them, then DN ends up having the same problems as Hume’s analysis of causation. People often know what caused what, even though they couldn’t for the life of them identify the relevant generalizations. It often happens that, in order to identify the relevant generalization, one must know what caused and what—that one must already have an explanation of the event in question, if only a crude one, if one is to identify the relevant generalization. Jones wants to know why the car blew up. He thinks about the sequence of events that he just witnessed. Smith got into his car and turned the key in the ignition; the engine turned over; a moment later the car exploded. If Smith falsely believes that Brown used his telekinetic powers to blow up the car, Smith’s search for covering laws will be futile. It is only if Smith does have a correct explanation, if only an...",

Was Tim allergic to fish?)” Yes, but knowledge of the how is knowledge of the what. How-knowledge is high-resolution what-knowledge. If all you know about the cause of Tim’s death was that it was brought on by his eating fish, then you don’t really know what caused his death. Your not knowing the “how” consists in your not knowing the specific mechanisms involved; and your not knowing those mechanisms consists in your not knowing the “what.” That having been settled, let us turn to the question: how are causal anomalies minimized? The answer: (ED32) the elimination of causal anomalies consists in the elimination of discontinuities. You see a red ball roll in one end of a tunnel with opaque walls A moment later, you see a similar ball roll out the other end. Given this information, it is natural to suppose that (H1) the ball you saw entering the tunnel rolled from one end of it to the other and then exited it. It’s a theoretical possibility that H1 isn’t the right explanation. Maybe what you saw is part of a magic-trick. But other things being equal, H1 is almost certainly correct. And even if it isn’t correct, it’s obviously a very reasonable hypothesis. The reason is that it eliminates the discontinuities in the events that you observed by supplementing them with events that you did not observe. Your observations tell you that some ball was instantaneously annihilated and that some other ball instantaneously popped into existence a few feet away. But if H1 is correct, none of these apparent discontinuities is an actual discontinuity. At least part of what makes H1 a good hypothesis is that, to the extent that it’s correct, reality is continuous. This suggests that to explain is to eliminate discontinuities. Explanation is discontinuity-elimination. In response to this, it will be said that: (OH)33 We can use your own example to prove that, contrary to what you are alleging, explanation is not the same thing as discontinuity-elimination. A ball rolls into one end of a tunnel and a similar ball rolls out the other. But the second ball isn’t identical with the first.

Even though it’s obviously unacceptable, H3 does as good a job of eliminating discontinuities as H1. Thus, contrary to what you are saying, discontinuity-elimination cannot be the essence of explanation. Contrary to what OH* alleges, H3 does not do as good a job as H1 of eliminating discontinuities. First of all, even though it seems, at least initially, to do as good a job as H1 of eliminating spatiotemporal discontinuities, H3 creates a number of theoretical discontinuities that H1 does not create. There is no independent evidence that balls turn into iguanas or vice versa. So, in supposing that H3 is correct, we’re supposing either (i) that the physical laws governing this one situation are very different from those governing other situations or (ii) that the observational data that we’ve had thus far, which strongly suggests that iguanas don’t turn into balls or vice versa, is very misleading as to the nature of reality. If (i) is the case, the laws of nature, and therefore the very structure of reality, had to undergo an abrupt and unprecedented change in order for the changes described by H3 to be possible. (And given the reasonable, though debatable (not to mention vague), supposition that the laws of nature are veritable spatiotemporal structures, it follows that H3 fails to eliminate discontinuities in a particularly egregious way.) If (ii) is the case, there is so little conformity between the data of observation and the structure of reality that we have no good reason to expect any of our observation-based beliefs, including our belief in (ii) itself, to be correct. Given obvious extensions of these points, it’s clear that H2 creates similar theoretical discontinuities. But H1 doesn’t have any of these problems. It doesn’t create any of the theoretical (or spatiotemporal) discontinuities that either H2 or H3 creates, and it eliminates each of the discontinuities eliminated by either. All of which suggests that, just as we proposed, discontinuity-elimination is the essence of explanation.",

But he’s not completely vague; he gives Brown some relevant information. A month after Smith leaves, Brown tells a friend of his that: (PS1) It’s probable that Smith is in France right now. PS1 is correct. It’s correct because, given the data available to Brown, it’s far more reasonable to believe that Brown is in France than it is to believe that he isn’t. And PS1 is correct even if, at the time, Brown is Spain. It doesn’t matter whether Brown is in France or not. What matters is that, given the available data, it’s more reasonable to believe that he is than it is to believe that he isn’t. PS1 says that, given such and such data, it’s probable that Smith is in France. It’s irrelevant that, from a phonetic viewpoint, there’s no expression of the form “given such and such data.” From a logical standpoint, there is such an expression (unless PS1 is completely meaningless). In general, probability is inherently relational. For this reason, the words “P is probably the case” may be correct when they come out of one person’s mouth and false when they come out of some other person’s mouth. This will happen if the data available to the one person makes P more belief-worthy than not-P and the data available to the other makes not-P more belief-worthy than P. A complete description of the universe would contain no probability statements. Given any statement S (that isn’t a probability statement), such a description would contain either S or not-S. Thus, probability is but “a measure of ignorance,” as Laplace put it. Somebody who knew everything could never correctly describe a proposition as probable but not certain.",

S has an “intrinsic” probability of greater than 50% iff S1. . . . Sn make it more likely than not that S, where S1 . . . Sn is a list of every true statement that doesn’t logically entail S. The idea is that, if you knew everything there was to know other than the fact that E jumps orbit at t, you could not learn more that was relevant to whether E would jump without actually learning whether E would jump. But, it will be said, the story is very different with statements that, as a matter of natural law either must happen or cannot happen. Let S* be a true statement falling into this category. No matter how small the likelihood that S* is false, there are true statements that, if conjoined with the truths already known, will shrink that likelihood even further without eliminating it. (It may be that, because of interference effects, it’s impossible to acquire more information that is relevant to whether S* is correct or not without actually learning whether S* is correct or not. But that would only be because those interference effects made it impossible to learn the truths that would enable you to shrink your margin of doubt.) Thus, intrinsic probability is a kind of evidential probability. One is dealing with intrinsic probability when, setting aside problems relating to interference effects, there is a limit to how much, short of learning whether the target statement is true or not, one’s margin of error can be reduced, and one has non-intrinsic evidential probability if there is no such limit. Nonetheless, I’m not convinced that intrinsic probability is, in fact, a form of evidential probability. As before, let S be a true statement alleging the occurrence of some event E that has an intrinsic probability of greater than 50% but less than 100%, and let S1 . . . Sn be a list that contains every true statement other than those that entail S. The statement “given S1 . . . Sn, S is more probable than not” does not say that, given S1 . . .

If one is to be justified in accepting SNS, one doesn’t need to know that Smith ever failed to show up to anything; and one doesn’t need to know that what the relevant individuals, whoever they might be, failed to do was to show up. One need only know that people similar (in some respect relevant in the present context) to Smith failed to do something similar (same qualification) to showing up.

It’s easy to ridicule the statistical conception of explanation by showing that events exactly like the one being explained haven’t occurred. But the situation being explained needn’t be a perfect replication of any past situation. It need only be like past situations in some very abstract respect. The problem with this response is that there is no way to understand the concept of “relevant similarity” in statistical terms; and in deciding what is relevantly similar to what, the advocate of SE is drawing on hypotheses that can’t possibly have received any confirmation of a purely statistical kind.

No. Let phi and psi be any two properties such that x has psi isn’t an analytic consequence of x has phi, or vice versa. If I know that there is no causal or, more generally, nomic connection between x’s being a phi, on the one hand, and x’s being a psi, on the other, then I have no reason to infer, from x’s being a phi, that x is also a psi. Even if, thus far, every ball withdrawn from the urn has been black, unless I have reason to believe that this concomitance has some basis in natural law or in some causal mechanism (e.g., the presence of a force field surrounding the urn that allows entry only to black balls, or some person’s resolute intention to allow no non-black balls into the urn), I must ipso facto regard it as nothing but coincidence that, thus far, every ball withdrawn has been black; and I must therefore not think it more likely than not that the next ball withdrawn will be black—for to think otherwise would be to commit the Monte Carlo fallacy.37 Thus, supposing that, in fact, this concomitance is mere coincidence, the generalization all the balls in the urn are black fails to receive any positive confirmation from its instances.38 For the same reason mutatis mutandis, the statement all non-black things are not balls in the urn, unless read as having nomic force, fails to receive support from its instances. And, of course, it also follows that HM, if read as doing nothing more than affirming a de facto concomitance, doesn’t receive support from its instances.

Let’s consider both options, starting with the first. Given that MH is taken to do more than affirm a de facto concomitance, if NH is taken to affirm nothing but a de facto concomitance, the two will, quite trivially, not be equivalent. For obviously MHN is not equivalent with HMA. The first is committed to its being the case that inter alia a thing’s being made of heated metal provides some kind of nomic basis for—or, in any case, is nomically or causally connected in some way with—that thing’s expanding. The second isn’t committed to there being any kind of nomic, or otherwise not purely extensional, connection between the property of non-expanding and the property of being made of heated metal. MHN is true only if certain nomic connections hold; HMA can be true in the absence of those connections. So there is no equivalence, or even the appearance of equivalence for that matter. We’ve just seen that, if we take MH to have nomic force (which we must—see above—if Hempel’s paradox is to arise), Hempel’s paradox doesn’t arise if we don’t take HM to have nomic content. In other words, if we take HM to do nothing more than affirm a de facto concomitance, then it won’t, as we’ve just seen, even appear to be equivalent with MHN, and nothing even resembling Hempel’s paradox arises. So if that paradox is to arise, then we must take HM to have nomic content. In light of this, consider the sentence: (HMN) For any x, if x isn’t expanding, then, as a matter of principle, x isn’t made of metal that is being heated, HMN says that a thing’s not being an expander provides some kind of (partial) nomic basis for its not being heated metal. Of course, the relationship that HMN bears to HM is analogous to the relationship that MHN bears to MH. But what is most important here is that HMN would be the right way—or, in any case, the (or, at least, a) natural way—to take HM if the latter were taken to do more than affirm a de facto concomitance between two properties.

Further suppose that, in W, x’s being something that is expanding causes x to turn into something that is metal whose temperature is continuously rising and whose volume is constantly increasing. And, to make things simple, suppose that, in W, all things made of heated metal got that way by, at some point in their histories, being things that were expanding. In that case, MHW would be correct in W: for there would, in that world, be a nomic connection between a thing’s being heated metal, on the one hand, and its being something that expands, on the other; moreover, the fact that, in W, all heated metal expands would have a basis in this nomic connection. But it would not, at least not on that account, be correct to say that, in W, a thing’s being made of heated metal provides a nomic basis for its expanding. In W, things expand before they become expanding heated metal. So, in W, a thing’s being heated metal obviously cannot cause it to expand.

There is thus no condition or object that is constituted to any degree by that non-event. Therefore, it isn’t identical with, or constitutive of, anything that falls within the scope of natural law. It isn’t, therefore, nomically connected to anything. A thing’s being composed of metal that is of a certain temperature is, in the relevant respects, like my pounding the table. Things are to be explained in terms of it. And, though not itself an “event,” it is constituted by various interacting events, all of which occupy space-time. So the skillet’s having a certain temperature, at a given time, is something that can, and indeed obviously must, stand in nomic relations.

In actuality, Duhem advocated a much more circumscribed position.) The so-called Duhem-Quine thesis is an extremely facile one. As before, suppose that, according to theory T, anyone who takes medication M will be acne-free within five hours. Given that Smith’s acne is going strong six hours after taking M, there’s nothing we can say that isn’t brazenly ad hoc and that doesn’t create vast numbers of otherwise non-existent anomalies. It’s obvious and trivial that, given any theory T that concerns the external world, no matter what observations we’ve had, it’s logically possible that T is false. So unless it’s completely hollow, the Duhem-Quine thesis can’t just say that, for any theory T that concerns the external world, no body of observations analytically entails that T is false. It must therefore be to the effect that, given any body of observations and given any theory T, the explanatory costs of accepting T are no greater and no smaller than the explanatory costs of rejecting T. But that statement is very obviously false. The data being what it is, the explanatory costs of holding onto T far outweigh the explanatory gains of doing so. If we hold onto it, we’re stuck with various anomalies that we wouldn’t otherwise be stuck with. If we reject it, we’re not stuck with those anomalies; nor are we stuck with any other anomalies that we weren’t already stuck with.

If x is what “Venus” in fact refers to, x is what “Venus” would refer to in any world semantically like ours. But “the LMS,” like “the current U.S. President,” is not a rigid designator; it refers to different things in semantically identical situations. (It used to refer to Carter; now it refers to Obama. But the semantic rules governing that expression haven’t changed in the least in the mean time.) In general, proper names are rigid designators. “Hesperus” and “Phosphorous” are proper names. Therefore, unlike “the LMS” and “the FES,” they are rigid designators. So as long as the semantic rules of English haven’t changed, there is some one object x such that (i) each refers to x; and, therefore, such that (ii) each of ‹Hesperus has phi› and ‹Phosphorous has phi› is true exactly if x has phi, a corollary being that (iii) “Hesperus is Phosphorous” (HIP) is true exactly if x is identical with x. It’s obvious that, for any object x, the proposition x is identical with x is necessarily true. But it’s equally obvious that the proposition expressed by HIP is empirical and, therefore, non-analytic. Therefore, HIP expresses a non-analytic necessary truth.",

PX merely registers the fact that a certain name is associated with a certain object. It doesn’t say anything (else) about that object. It doesn’t say whether that object is tall or short, friendly or unfriendly. PX is exceedingly threadbare. But the information through which I am learning PX is very different from PX itself. That information—that pre-semantic information—is along the lines of: (BPX) There is some individual y such that, a moment ago (7:00 P.M., March 14, 2009), y rang me; such that, using a voice-modulation device to disguise his voice, y is making threatening statements; and such that I am being told, by y himself, that “Phosphorous” is y’s name. Here must we repeat (mutatis mutandis) what we said a moment ago. There is some y such that “Phosphorous” merely labels y. “Hesperus” doesn’t have for any part of its meaning anything having to do with the property of talking on the phone with me at a certain time, or of using a voice-modulation device, or of making threats. But the information through which I learn who “Phosphorous” labels does concern such properties. That information is descriptive; a certain person y is perceptually represented, and thus described, to me as having certain characteristics (calling me at a certain time, making certain statements, etc.) and, with the help of this information, it is also being made clear to me that “Phosphorous” names x. But that descriptive information is not itself a part of the semantic rule that, with its help, I am learning—that is to say, it is not itself any part of PX. PX is extremely threadbare; it merely puts a label on a certain object. So the just-mentioned descriptive information has no place in the semantics of “Phosphorous,” its relevance is confined to the pre-semantic act of assigning it to the right object. That information is entirely pre-semantic. But such pre-semantic information can have an incalculably profound effect on what is (non-semantically; i.e., non-literally) conveyed by utterances.

    "text": "correspondence with a proper subset of itself.” When non-trivial truths are described as “analytic,” what is meant is that they are non-empirically true. This is what we will mean by it, as earlier stated. There is one last ambiguity to deal with. As some philosophers use it, the word “analytic” is synonymous with “formally true.” Formal truth is a property of sentences. It’s the property of being “syntactically” true.5 A sentence is “syntactically true” if any sentence having the same syntactic form is true. So “either John is tall or John is not tall” is formally true, and thus analytic (in one sense of the word), because every sentence having the form “either P or not-P” is true. This obviously isn’t how we’ll be using the term “analytic,” given that, as previously stated, we’re using it to pick out a property of propositions, not sentences. (Propositions don’t have syntax. Syntax is a property of complex expressions. Propositions aren’t expressions.) A final note: even though sentence-analyticity diverges from proposition-analyticity, the two ultimately coalesce. What does it mean to say that, although the proposition it encodes is synthetic, a given token of “I am here now” is analytic? It means that, the semantic rules of English being what they are, the proposition that any given token of “I am here now” is true is analytic. (Given that any token t1 of “I” refers to the person who utters t1, that any token t2 of “now” refers to the time at which t2 was uttered, and so on, it follows that a token t of “I am here now” couldn’t be false.)",

    "text": "express the same proposition.) It doesn’t even mean that any proposition’s structure is perfectly represented by that of any of the sentences that express it. Here’s what it does mean: to the extent that the sentences of a given language fail to mirror the structures of the propositions they express, that language is expressively frozen. So if L and L* are any two languages, then ceteris paribus L’s expressive power exceeds L*s to the extent that the structures of L-sentences do a better job than those of L*-sentences of mirroring the structures of the propositions they represent. Here’s the idea. Let L* be a language that has only simple symbols. So the L*-sentence for “snow is colder than water” is some single, syntactically simple symbol, the same being true of every other L*-sentence. Obviously, there’s no limit to what L* can express, since there’s no limit in principle to how many primitive symbols can belong to a language. But, since each symbol belonging to L* is simple, it’s necessary to add a new symbol to L* every time one wants to make a point that isn’t the literal meaning of one of its simple expressions. Nothing could be said in L* that hadn’t been said before: it would be impossible to express discoveries. Symbols would have to be added ad hoc to say anything new. But given a language L that has many ways of combining its primitive symbols into complex ones, it’s expressive capabilities will dwarf those of L*, so long as the number of primitive expressions belonging to L rises above a certain, extremely small minimum number. L* is totally inflexible. L is highly flexible, and can do a lot with a little. Other things being equal, the extent to which one language’s expressive resources exceed those of another is directly proportional to the extent by which sentences of the one language exceed their counterparts in the other in respect of syntactic complexity. There is only one viable explanation of this last fact: Syntactic structure mirrors propositional structure. The syntactic devices that endow a language with expressive flexibility correspond to the relations by which propositions are constructed out of their constituents and, in particular, by which propositions are constructed out of other propositions. Thus, we can confidently say that the (syntactic) structures of sentences tend to mirror those of the propositions they express.",

Given this assumption, we must ask the following question: Are any propositions necessarily true? Yes. Why is this? Because the assumption that no propositions are necessarily true is self-undermining. Let me now explain why. For argument’s sake, suppose that: (NN) No propositions are necessarily true. First of all, is NN itself necessarily true or not? It has to be one or the other. If NN is a necessary truth, it’s a counterexample to itself and is therefore false. So let’s suppose for argument’s sake that NN is contingently true. In that case, it could be false. In other words, there is some possible world W where some proposition P is necessarily true. A proposition is necessarily true iff it’s true in all possible worlds. So given that P is necessarily true in W, it follows that P is true in every world. Thus, P is true in our world, and P is true in every world. Thus, P is necessarily true in our world, and NN is therefore false. To sum up: NN is self-defeating if it’s necessarily true, and NN is self-defeating if it’s true but not necessarily so. Therefore, NN is false. A similar argument: if NN is true, then the statement (i) “P isn’t necessarily true” necessarily follows the statement (ii) “P is a proposition,” and it is therefore a necessary truth that (i) isn’t false if (ii) is true. So NN cannot be true unless it’s false, and it’s therefore false.",

If I reflexively bark it out when I see a fire, I’m no more affirming that there’s a fire than I am if I start sweating in response to the heat given off by a nearby fire. These points are substantiated in Chapter 4. Also, in 1957, Noam Chomsky published his groundbreaking work Syntactic Structures, which, along with the many other important works that Chomsky was soon to publish, made it clear that Quine’s linguistic behaviorism simply didn’t model the relevant facts. Chomsky proposed an alternative theory, according to which inborn cognitive structures are largely, though obviously not entirely, determinative of how we learn and use language. Unlike Quine’s theory, Chomsky’s is splendidly borne out by the facts. Quine and others accused Chomsky of putting forth a priori theories that lacked an adequate empirical grounding. This is both false and confused. It’s true that according to Chomsky’s theory we have a priori knowledge. But it doesn’t follow that Chomsky’s theory is itself a priori. Chomsky’s theory is based on empirical data; and, unlike Quine’s theory, it fits that data. And even though, according to Quine’s theory, there is no a priori knowledge, it doesn’t follow that Quine’s theory is itself empirically well-founded. It isn’t. It’s rooted in the a priori, and easily disconfirmed, presumption that all psychological phenomena are to be explained in the same way as the salivating of Pavlov’s dog. One of the great ironies of empiricism is that it’s one of the most unempirical theories of all time. People learn languages. Dogs don’t. A dog wouldn’t even learn the rudiments of a language were it to experience the sensory simulations that enable a human being to master one. This shows that, unlike dogs, human beings are endowed with innate cognitive structures that enable them to derive an integrated and complex body of knowledge from such stimulations. The same point mutatis mutandis holds of any cognitive skill that human beings can acquire that animals cannot. Empiricism is therefore inconsistent with empirical evidence of the most blatant and widespread kind. In any case, despite the vast and ever-growing body of evidence in support of Chomsky’s anti-Quinean views, Quine stuck to his guns, and in the 45 years...",

And even if it could, it wouldn’t relieve of you of the burden of having to interpret the data for yourself. For argument’s sake, suppose that the data were self-interpreting, and that its self-interpretations were disclosed to you in periodic reports. Any such report would itself be given to you in terms of raw data that you’d have to analyze; so you couldn’t even understand the report unless you already knew how to interpret the data. Second, once you did understand the report, you’d have no good reason to trust it unless you could find some independent corroboration for it. Finding such corroboration would involve coming up with your own interpretation of the data and seeing how well it matched the interpretation in the report. So even if per impossible perceptual data could self-interpret, one could learn nothing about the external world from those interpretations unless one could interpret the data for oneself. It is, therefore, totally incoherent to suppose that one could know on the basis of observation alone how to interpret the data of observation; and since it’s totally incoherent to suppose that one could have theoretical or, therefore, scientific knowledge without interpreting the data, it is totally incoherent to suppose that any science should be strictly observation-based. There is necessarily a non-observational component to the acquisition of scientific knowledge. Interpreting data involves being able to discern abstract resemblances between different concrete situations. Doing this, in its turn, involves knowing necessary truths. Seeing that two objects are alike in respect of (e.g.) their shape involves seeing that they fulfill conditions that, if not fulfilled by an object, necessarily preclude it from having the shape in question. Seeing that otherwise dissimilar objects x and y are both square-shaped involves knowing that, were an object to have more sides than x or y, it would for that very reason fail to have the same shape as them, and it also involves knowing that, if an object had a different color from x or y, it would not for that very reason fail to have the same shape as them. One can’t know that x and y have the same shape unless one knows that an object’s having four sides necessarily disqualifies it from being shape-identical with those objects. In general,...",

(2) Either Helsinki is in Finland or Helsinki is not in Finland.We saw in Chapter 4 that sentence-tokens are the only expressions that are true or false—that sentence-types are neither, since their meanings are rules that assign truths and falsehoods to their tokens, and aren’t truths or falsehoods per se. But to avoid verbosity, we’ll often speak as though sentence-types per se can be formally true. So we’ll say, for example, “(1) is formally true,” and we’ll discuss the conditions that “sentences” must satisfy to be formally true. But it’s crucial to bear in mind that this is only an expedient way of talking about sentence-tokens—of saying that tokens of (1) are formally true, etc. What is “formal truth”? What does it mean to describe (1), for example, as “formally true”? Here’s the canonical answer (“FT” stands for “formal truth,” of course): (FT) Formal truth is syntactic truth. A sentence is “syntactically true” if, given only its syntactic structure, it cannot fail to be true. Thus, a sentence is formally true if no sentence having the same syntactic structure is false. FT cannot be accepted. A linguist would say that (1) “grass is green or grass is not green” has the same syntax as (2) “grass is green and grass is not green.” As linguists use the word “syntax,” two expressions have the same syntax if the way in which the one is built out of its parts is identical with the way in which the other is built out of its parts. For example, “Bill hates Ted” and “Laura loves Sally,” though having very different meanings, have the same syntax, the reason being that they’re structurally identical. The one is built out of its simple constituents in the very way that the other is built out of its constituents. Thus, it isn’t because of any structural differences between them that they have different meanings. The relevant difference is substructural. It lies in the fact that the meaning of “and” is different from that of “or.” So the difference between (1) and (2) is like the difference between “John is tall” and “Mary is short”: it lies entirely in the fact that the primitive, semantically unstructured constituents of the one have different meanings from their counterparts in the other.

But if it was generated by some rule, then Quine’s answer fails to identify it and thus fails to say what formal truth is. An analogy may help. When asked to define the expression “number,” I simply list the various different kinds of numbers (“real,” “whole,” “rational,” “imaginary,” etc.). Have I answered the question? No. Even though I’ve listed the various different kinds of numbers, I haven’t said what numbers are, and I thus haven’t provided any reason why fractions are on that list but birds are not. Accordingly, my answer doesn’t give anyone a reason not to extend that list as he or she pleases—not to decide that birds and rocks are numbers. Of course, nobody would extend the list in such an absurd way. But that’s only because our intuitions strongly suggest that there is some characteristic had in common by reals, rationals, etc., that birds and rocks don’t have. Second, there are truths not covered by Quine’s analysis that don’t appear to differ in any relevant respect from those covered by that analysis. Many modal statements are in this category—for example, “if it’s necessarily the case that Smith is a mammal if Smith is a dog, then if it’s necessarily the case that Smith is a mammal if it’s necessarily the case that Smith is a dog.” There doesn’t seem to be any relevant difference between that statement and one that conforms to Quine’s analysis—for example, “if Smith is a mammal if Smith is a dog, and Smith is an animal if Smith is mammal, then Smith is an animal if Smith is a dog.” So there doesn’t seem to be any good reason why “necessarily,” unlike “if . . . then . . . ,” doesn’t make it onto Quine’s list. Of course, one could deal with this by adding “necessarily” to that list.

Thus, Wittgenstein’s thesis that all analytic truth is formal truth is not only wrong but incoherent. Here is another illustration of that fact. The sentence: (JTB) any case of knowledge is a case of justified true belief is an analytic, not an empirical, truth. But it isn’t a formal truth, since it has the same form as (NTB) any case of knowledge is a case of unjustified false belief, which is false. Wittgenstein grants that there seem to be analytically true sentences that aren’t formally true. But he denies that there are really are such sentences. Here is what he says: (AFT17) Though it seems not to be formally true, the sentence (JTB) “any case of knowledge is a case of justified true belief” is in fact formally true, the reason being that it is an abbreviation of (JTBF) “any case of non-accidentally true, justified belief is a case of justified true belief,” or, at any rate, of some other formally true sentence. AFT is false. JTB is not JTBF in disguise. They express different propositions. JTB is informative. JTBF is not. One can accept the proposition meant by the one without accepting the proposition meant by the other. JTB and JTBF express equivalent propositions (assuming, as we are, that JTBF is correct). But if JTB is to be a mere abbreviation of JTBF, both must express the very same proposition. They don’t; so AFT is wrong. According to AFT, any given informal analytic truth can be turned into a formal truth by replacing expressions with analytic definitions of themselves—by replacing “circle” with “closed planar figure of uniform curvature,” etc. But such a formalization would presuppose the correctness of all the analyses involved. And none of those analyses would be expressed by formal truths. JTBF is indeed formal. But it doesn’t express an analysis.

But the tentative, and perhaps partial, list just given makes it clear what, at least approximately, is meant by the expression “intrinsic good.”",

    "text": "Smith might be happy. And, undeniably, Smith’s happiness is a good thing. But it is by no means something that is in all cases praiseworthy. To take a more stark example, the happiness of a rabbit is a good thing. But, given their cognitive limitations, rabbits are not capable of acting in a praiseworthy manner. To be sure, it’s good that they’re happy (when they’re happy). But, good though a rabbit’s happiness is, the rabbit doesn’t deserve praise for being happy—it isn’t in the same category as Gandhi or Mother Teresa. So happiness is non-instrumentally good, while at the same time not being commendable. (“Commendable” is a synonym for “praiseworthy.”) But, of course, some intrinsically good things are praiseworthy. Suppose that Jones spends a great deal of time and energy working for a charity and that he does so knowing he does not reap any kind of practical benefit from his labors. Jones’ behavior is obviously praiseworthy—that is, it is commendable, and it is also intrinsically good. Another example: Suppose that Smith is a naturally talented musician who plays the piano very well. Suppose, in fact, that Smith is blessed with so much native talent that he never had to work hard to play the piano well—it just came to him naturally. Smith’s musical talent is intrinsically good, as is the happiness it brings him. But Smith doesn’t deserve any praise for happening to have been blessed with this talent. (How could he deserve praise for the occurrence of something over which he has no control?) It’s good that he has such talent. But he doesn’t deserve to be praised for it in the way in which Mother Teresa deserves to be praised for her good works. Bottom line: there are two kinds of intrinsic goods—those which are commendable and those which are not.",

If a statement’s truth or falsehood is to be established on the basis of objective fact, that strongly suggests that the statement itself is one of fact, as opposed to “mere opinion.” This is because, if a statement stands if the facts are one way and fails if they aren’t that way, then that statement says, or at least implies, that the facts are that way. And, in that case, that statement has factual content. Bottom line: any position that can be rationally disputed is likely to have an objective basis. KV can be rationally disputed, and that’s why it’s not a matter of “mere opinion.” CB cannot, and that’s why it is a matter of “mere opinion” or “preference.”",

    "text": "When we were discussing (i), we saw that if it is possible to cite reasons for or against a viewpoint, then that viewpoint, if correct, has an objective basis. If you know that Smith murdered Jones, then you are able to provide reasons why I should believe you. Maybe you can show me video footage of Smith doing the deed. Maybe you can remind me of how often Smith fumed about Jones. Maybe you can show me legal documents that make it clear that Smith stood to make a lot of money if Jones died. By this reasoning, if the merits of ethical positions can be rationally disputed, then it is probable that ethical positions, when correct, have an objective basis. So can ethical positions be rationally debated? Can one cite reasons for and against them? Yes. We saw this a moment ago when discussing marriage. Here is another example. Is the death penalty right or wrong? People disagree about this. But even among those who disagree, there is considerable debate as to what would have to hold in order for the death penalty to be justified. So, for example, if it were made clear that the death penalty systematically led to the execution of innocent people, then most people would agree that the death penalty was not right. The question “how many innocent people are executed for crimes they didn’t commit?” is a strictly factual question. And a lot of the debate over the ethical integrity of death penalty depends on how this strictly factual question is answered. Suppose it turned out that the death penalty made governments less likely to invest in social policies that would prevent the commission of capital offences in the first place. In that case, the vast majority of people who now support the death penalty as justified would probably cease to do so. (Of course, there would be a few holdouts. But that doesn’t mean anything. There are still people who think the Earth is flat.) It is a strictly factual question of whether the death penalty inhibits, encourages, or is neutral with respect to the implementation of policies that discourage the commission of murder and other capital offenses. So, as before, we see that, to the extent that it’s hard to decide whether the death penalty is good or bad, that’s because certain purely factual issues are hard to decide (e.g., it’s...",

Whether Smith is happy or not has nothing to do with my opinion or anyone else’s. (It doesn’t even have to do with Smith’s opinion. His opinion is more likely to be accurate, than other people’s, but if it’s correct, that’s because it’s rooted in the relevant facts. In fact, Smith’s opinion as to whether he was happy wouldn’t be more likely to be accurate than anyone else’s if it were just a “matter of opinion” whether he were happy or not.) The question “how happy is so and so, if at all?” is a strictly factual question, and ethical judgments are not a “matter of opinion” if utilitarianism is correct. According to another view, for something to be good is for it to be identical with, or logically required by, a practice on which human flourishing depends. By “human flourishing” is meant the actualization of human abilities. So, according to the view in question, if you have an innate talent for writing fiction, then you are flourishing insofar as you are putting that talent to use and failing to flourish insofar as you are not. It’s a question of fact whether so and so is putting his innate musical ability to good use. Given any creature and any inborn ability on its part, it’s a question of fact to what extent, if any, it’s using that ability. And it’s a question of fact to what extent a given act on your part or anybody else’s promotes or thwarts the expression of inborn ability. So if the just-descried moral view is correct, moral questions are factual questions. “Is x good?” is identical with the question “does x promote or thwart the development of people’s abilities?”2 ENDNOTES",

Smith is a marvelous composer, and you know this. But you also detest Smith. One day you hear a performance of one of his works, and the experience is torture. But you know that, were it not for the fact that you don’t like Smith, hearing that work would be exquisitely pleasurable. So you know that it’s good, even though, because of this random fact about your past, it doesn’t bring you pleasure. And you also know that, so far as other people’s music appreciation isn’t similarly blunted by such person-specific idiosyncrasies, they would derive pleasure from listening to this work of Smith’s. In general, when people describe a work of art as “good,” they mean that, setting aside irrelevancies of the sort just described, it brings people pleasure. The same thing mutatis mutandis holds in the moral sphere. In general, people regard acts that bring them happiness as “moral” and regard acts that bring them unhappiness as “immoral.” People act “immorally” when they beat you, and they act “morally” when they help you. But, of course, people sometimes regard things that bring them no pleasure, or even displeasure, as “moral”; and they sometimes regard things that bring them acute pleasure as “immoral.” Many a person has committed heinous crimes and then commended the government for putting him in jail. In many such cases, if not all of them, the person is condemning acts that he obviously committed because doing so was itself enjoyable or was expected to bring him happiness down the line, and he is also commending an act on the government’s part that will bring him untold misery. But how is this possible, if, as we’ve seen reason to believe, for x to be good is for x to increase happiness? Because “x is good” means “x makes people happy to the extent so far as individual-specific, non-transferable facts about them aren’t a factor.” So the condemned prisoner who praises the government for putting him away knows that, were his circumstances not so abnormal, the government’s putting him away would let him sleep easier at night (and its not doing so would keep him awake in terror).

    "text": "no basis in the music itself—if it didn‘t derive from his being sensitive to it actual virtues—it would be wrong to say that Smith had been damaged in any way. On the contrary, we’d have to say that the blow had made him better. If his previous enjoyment of music had nothing to do with anything inherent in the music, his enjoyment of it was pure projection. But now, thanks to the blow, he doesn’t respond to music in this delusional way. But since Smith obviously wasn’t enhanced by the blow, and since he obviously was diminished by it, we have to say that his previous enjoyment of it did involve some awareness on his part of its merits. It’s crucial to distinguish between enjoying something, on the one hand, and being caused by it to experience pleasure, on the other. Given only that my hearing Chopin’s ballad in G-minor gives me pleasure, it doesn’t follow that I’m enjoying it. Maybe I know that my arch-nemesis Jones, who is in the room, hates it and, to my extreme delight, is in agony because it’s blaring from the speakers. Here the G-minor ballad is causing me joy; but I’m not enjoying it. There’s a difference between being caused to feel good by X, on the one hand, and enjoying X, on the other. When this distinction is given its due, emotivism collapses, and so does every form of value-nihilism. (By “value-nihilism” I mean any doctrine to the effect that “x is good” either means nothing or means that x is liked or otherwise looked upon favorably by some person or group.) There are a lot of reasons why some object might make you feel good. Not all of those reasons are of an aesthetic nature. A story will help make this clear. Smith owns a Picasso. He hangs it in his front hall, where visitors are bound to see it. The fact that it’s there makes him feel good. It makes him feel good not because it’s a great work of art, but because he believes that having it will improve his status and, therefore, his professional and romantic prospects. Smith neither likes nor dislikes the painting per se. In general, Smith neither likes nor dislikes art in general. He doesn’t understand it. As far as he can tell, paintings are just discolorations on a canvas. The Picasso makes Smith feel...",

(The goodness of any one of them is “incommensurable,” as some ethicists put it, with the goodness of either of the others.) But that doesn’t mean that every musical work is as good as every other musical work. “Dark Side of the Moon” isn’t supposed to be good in the same way as Beethoven’s 24th Sonata; and that sonata is supposed to be good in the same way as Tchaikovsky’s violin concerto. But there are works that are supposed to be good in the same way as Beethoven’s 24th sonata but, at the same time, aren’t good in that way, at least not to the same degree. (Any one of Clementi’s piano sonatas would be an example.) There are musical works that, given the genre to which they belong, are supposed to be good in the same way as “Dark Side of the Moon”, but aren’t good in that way, at least to the same degree. (An example would be “Beast of Burden” by the Rolling Stones, which even the Rolling Stones themselves would admit isn’t one of their better songs and isn’t as good as “Dark Side of the Moon.”) In any case, it’s patently obvious that some composers are better than others. I used to compose. I was better at it than the other people in my high school. But when I moved beyond the pathetically narrow horizons of my high school existence, I found that I was seriously outclassed. I wish I could compose like Mozart (or Roger Daltry); but I cannot. Many a musician wishes that he were a better composer than he is. And no such musician can coherently believe that no musical work is better than any other. For if all musical works were equal merit, then ex hypothesi all composers would be of equal merit. Moral nihilism fails for much the same reasons that aesthetic nihilism fails. I see wealthy person X give money to poor person Y. Let’s refer to this situation as S. S makes me feel good.

And, of course, your belief that Tim stole your bicycle is either true or false, as is your belief that Sally got married. But your anger at Tim’s (supposed) act of theft isn’t true or false, and neither is your happiness about Sally’s nuptials. Emotions presuppose beliefs; but emotions aren’t themselves beliefs. If you’re happy, you’re happy that such and such is the case. So you’re happiness presupposes that you believe that such and such is the case. But, while that belief is either true or false, your happiness about it is neither. The same is true of all other emotions. If you’re worried, you’re worried that such and such might happen and you therefore believe it possible that such and such might happen. This belief may or may not be correct. (Your worry is “well-grounded” if that belief is correct, and it’s otherwise not well-grounded. But your worry itself is not true or false.) So, whatever it is that your being worried adds to your belief, it isn’t something true or false. What it adds may be important from a personal viewpoint; but it’s neither here nor there as far as your knowledge of the world is concerned. The position just described was advocated by David Hume, and we’ll henceforth refer to it as “Hume’s view.” Hume’s view, we will now see, is totally false. Emotions are true or false.

When I played soccer in high school, one of my team-mates, who we’ll call “Ben,” had a rather serious respiratory disorder, which caused his lungs to fill up with fluid whenever he did vigorous exercise for more than a few minutes. But Ben was an ardent soccer player, and he played as much as his condition would permit. During a match, he’d play for as long as he could, and then he’d have to take a time out to let his lungs drain, during which time he experienced painful, wracking coughs. During these time-outs, Ben was upset. He was upset about his symptoms, about his inability to breathe properly, etc. Of course, it was playing soccer that set off these symptoms. But he wasn’t upset that he had played soccer. That was the one thing he was happy about. This confirms that having a negative emotion about X isn’t the same thing as being caused by X to have a negative emotion. What upset Ben was that his doing something which didn’t upset him caused him such unpleasantness. Another thing he was upset about was that his illness prevented him from playing soccer as much as he wanted to. Ben would obviously be happy if he were cured of his illness and could therefore play soccer without any problems. But he wouldn’t just be happy. He’d be happy that he could play soccer without any problems; he’d be happy that he was no longer prevented from doing what he wanted to do. I therefore propose that Ben’s being happy under that circumstance would be identical with his recognizing that he could do something he wanted to do. Consider an alternative universe W where Ben is exactly as he is here, except that he doesn’t have any desire to play soccer (or to do or have anything for which playing soccer is a necessary prerequisite). In W, Ben has the earlier-described malady and he’s unhappy about it, but he isn’t unhappy that it prevents him from playing soccer. In W, he never wanted to play soccer in the...",

If, in actuality, Ben were suddenly cured of his illness, and he thus realized he could fulfill his life’s dream of playing soccer, could he possibly not be happy? No, and it would be incoherent to say otherwise. Thus, a necessary and sufficient condition for Ben’s being happy that he can now play soccer is he knows himself to have some desire that, in now being able to play soccer, he is able to gratify.

Given only that individual (or nation or culture) X has an excellent moral code and Y has a bad moral code, it doesn’t follow that X can force his moral code on Y; it doesn’t follow that X has the right to intercede in Y’s affairs. For it may be that the damage done to people by intervening in their affairs is greater than the damage that such an intervention would prevent. If we launch a wholesale invasion on a country, so as to prevent its otherwise superb president from being mean to his children, we’ll do more harm than good; and what we’re doing is immoral, even if, thanks to it, the president’s children are never again mistreated. There’s another reason why it can be immoral to be intolerant of what is immoral. People can’t flourish without having a certain amount of freedom. Therefore, it is wrong to inhibit other people’s freedom (except in so far as such abridgments are necessary to prevent other, greater ones). Were X to force its moral views on Y, the resulting abridgment of Y’s freedom might be more immoral than the misbehavior on Y’s part that it was X’s intention to stop. And in that case, X’s intervention would be immoral, even though Y’s moral code was itself immoral. Moral principles as conditional truths Thus, far we’ve conceded to Argument #1 that moral truths don’t pre-exist human beings. But there’s no need to make that concession. Let “PBS” be our short-hand way of referring to our psychological-biological structure. Moral principles can be seen as being to the effect that if there were creatures having PBS, then it would follow that treating those creatures in certain ways would be wrong while treating them in certain other ways would be right. Suppose that strange evolutionary turn creates creatures that, although not biologically human, are friendly and are capable of connecting with human beings in an emotionally meaningful way (e.g., they would care about people, come to trust them, etc.). Even, so far as we know, though such creatures do not now exist, we know that it would be wrong to cause them unnecessary suffering; we know that it would be wrong to alter the condition of such a creature in a painful or damaging way.

If, while continuing to have slaves, slave-owners brazenly admitted that slavery was evil they would mobilize otherwise inert abolitionist forces. If they don’t admit this, and instead rationalize what they’re doing, a thin but powerful margin of doubt will keep some of these forces at bay, and will also enable themselves to live with themselves. It’s often convenient for people to turn a blind eye to moral truths. For this reason, moral laws, even when known, aren’t always implemented and also aren’t explicitly endorsed. It follows that moral laws aren’t conventions. Conventions cannot fail to be implemented. It cannot be a convention that people wear green hats on Sunday unless people actually do so. Argument #2: The argument from cultural relativism. Moral convictions vary from culture to culture. In some cultures, polygamy is accepted. In others, it isn’t. One possibility is that, given an ethical divergence between two cultures, one of those cultures must be wrong. So, just as two people can’t disagree about whether Helsinki is the capital of Finland without at least one of those people being wrong, so two cultures can’t have different ethical viewpoints without at least one of them being wrong. Another possibility is that, when two cultures disagree in this way, neither is right and neither is wrong. One culture likes polygamy. The other doesn’t. And that’s the end of it. The first option is implausible. If I like tennis, and you prefer soccer, it makes no sense to say that one of us is right and the other is wrong. If culture X likes polygamy and Y does not, it makes equally little sense to say that one of them is right and the other wrong. So the second option must be the right one. When cultures diverge ethically, neither is right and neither is wrong. But if there were moral facts, somebody would be right and somebody would be wrong. Therefore, there are no moral facts. Analysis of Argument #2 First of all, people knowingly do all sorts of immoral things. So given only that such and such is done in a given culture, it doesn’t follow that people in that culture think that it’s right to do such and such.

First of all, the cure can be worse than the disease. The Dictator of Country X, let us assume, beats his wife. This is immoral. But if we were to invade X to prevent this, the result could be a breakdown in order that was followed by a flood of murders, rapes, etc., which, collectively, would make for a situation far worse than the one we were trying to correct. When we make predictions about a country, we tend to rely heavily on knowledge of regularity-conducive structures, such as governments and other stable institutions. When a country is invaded, those institutions are ex hypothesi undermined. Therefore, our methods for predicting occurrences in that county cease to be reliable. An intervention isn’t justified unless there’s a reasonable expectation that the post-intervention situation is better than the pre-intervention one. Since interventions make it hard to have such expectations, it follows that they are often unjustified. So it’s one thing to say that we have the right to change X if female circumcision is common practice there. It’s a very different thing to say that it is right of X to countenance this abominable practice. A failure to see that these are entirely different propositions underlies the view that whatever goes on within a nation’s (or culture’s) borders is ipso facto morally good. Another relevant point is that no person and no nation would have much autonomy if it weren’t allowed to do anything wrong. Nobody would have much freedom under a government that micromanaged individual morality, and no nation would have much freedom under an international government that micromanaged national morality. It’s obvious that autonomy is a good thing. Since a precondition for personal or national autonomy is being allowed, within limits, to do wrong, it follows that one can have an obligation to refrain from preventing acts that one knows to be wrong. This shows the spuriousness of the inference from “what so and so is doing is wrong” to “we have the right to stop so and so from doing it.” Argument #3 Science has no use for moral facts.

Thus, ethical statements say what should occur, not what does occur. But reality is described by saying what there is, not what there should be. If true, “Smith killed Jones” describes reality; it says what happened. So far as “Smith was wrong to kill Jones” describes reality, it says the same thing as “Smith killed Jones.” So far as it doesn’t say the same thing, it doesn’t describe reality and therefore says nothing. So “Smith was wrong to kill Jones” says nothing not also said by “Smith killed Jones.” In general, “x exists and x should (or should not) exist” says nothing not said by “x exists.” Therefore “x exists and is good” says nothing not said by “x exists,” and neither does “x exists and x is bad.” The words “x is bad” and “x is good” add nothing; so they say nothing. And since they say nothing, they say nothing true or false. “x is good” isn’t true or false, and neither is “x is bad.” Ethical “statements” aren’t true or false and therefore aren’t even statements. They’re pseudo-statements, not real ones. Analysis of Argument #47 Moral imperatives are hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one of the form: given that you want x, you should do y. Hypothetical imperatives always fall within the scope of natural science, as we will now see. You cannot give an amoral person any good reason to be moral. Given that he is amoral and that his values radiate from that fact, it would be deeply irrational of him to heed your injunction to be moral. Of course, it’s sometimes to one’s practical advantage for one’s behavior to coincide with that of a moral person’s. But that’s irrelevant, since an act done for prudential reasons isn’t a moral act, even if it’s externally indistinguishable from one. Any reason that anyone has...",

    "text": "Argument #5 Ethical statements have a property that sets them apart from all others: if understood and believed true, ethical statements necessarily incline one towards certain actions. If you really understand and agree with the principle that you should keep promises, you cannot fail to have an inclination to keep your promises. This doesn’t mean that you necessarily will keep your promises. You may have other inclinations that override your inclination to keep your promises. For example, given your burning wish to be a millionaire by age 40, along with your correct belief that this wish of yours won’t come true if you’re utterly scrupulous, you may choose not to keep your promises, even though you wish that circumstances didn’t force you to break them. But if you have no inclination to keep your promises, then you either don’t understand the principle that you should do so or you don’t really agree with it. So far as this appears false, it’s because it’s easy for people who don’t understand or agree with ethical principles to impersonate those who do. Somebody who, while not having a shred of ethical insight, knows the right talking points can easily pass for somebody who not only understands, but also accepts, the precept that one should keep one’s promises. Be that as it may, what is relevant here is that wherever there’s actual understanding and acceptance of an ethical principle, there is, for that very reason, an inclination to act in accordance with that principle. Descriptive statements don’t have this feature. You can fully understand and accept any descriptive statement without having any inclination to do anything. You can understand and concede the truth of the statement “if the button is pushed, many will die and those who don’t will be miserable; if it isn’t pushed, nobody will die and everybody will be happy” without having the slightest inclination to abstain from pushing the button. But you can’t understand “you morally shouldn’t push the button (since, e.g., it will kill innocent people)” without having such an inclination. So descriptive statements lack, whereas ethical statements have, the property that, if understood and believed true, they necessarily impel one towards certain acts. Since correct ethical statements, supposing them to exist, necessarily incline those who understand and agree with them to behave in certain ways, and since descriptive statements don’t have this feature, ethical statements aren’t descriptive statements....",

Indeed, the idea that we’re irresistibly drawn towards ethical behavior is so contrary to so many obvious realities that a fair amount of wishful thinking must underlie acceptance of it. The ethical is what you don’t want to do. If you wanted to do it, it wouldn’t be ethical anymore; it would just be another form of recreation, albeit one that, like friendship and certain other forms of intimacy, happened to conduce to the welfare of others. Also, contrary to what Argument #5 assumes, it’s only to the extent that one has beliefs as to the consequences of a given act that one feels compelled, morally or otherwise, to perform it. You feel compelled to give money to charity X only to the extent that you believe that, in so doing, you’d be alleviating hunger (or some such). Knowledge of moral truths compels action only to the extent that it coincides with knowledge of descriptive truths. So the extent that it’s true to say that, if there are moral truths, knowledge of them compels action, it’s only because moral truths coincide with descriptive truths. Argument #6 Ethical statements are nothing more than instruments of propaganda. They are ways of tricking people into accepting existing distributions of power and wealth. In Hitler’s Germany, obeying the Führer was “good” and disobeying him was “bad”; killing Jews was “right” and protecting them was “wrong.” In Stalin’s Russia, questioning the Communist Party was “the ultimate treachery,” and blindly following its dictates was “the highest excellence.” In capitalist countries, governmental regulation of private property is often described as “a gross violation of one’s most fundamental human rights,” even if such regulation is needed to provide basic services for many people. By the same token, there’s “nothing wrong” with adding more millions to one’s already large fortune, even if doing so involves impoverishing others, stripping them of opportunities, and generally diminishing their quality of life. These statements endorse values that support existing power structures. They trick the have-nots into helping the haves; and they do it by condemning acts that would help the have-nots and by praising acts that would help the haves. In general, ethical codes manipulate the have-nots into hurting themselves and helping the haves. This is their function, and they discharge this function by representing injustice as justice.

Thus, there is at best a circumstantial connection between morality and self-interest: in some circumstances it is to one’s advantage to act morally; in others it isn’t. But even this seemingly modest statement exaggerates the connection between morality and self-interest. So far as one’s reason for behaving ethically is that it is to one’s advantage to do so, one’s behavior has no moral worth and, therefore, is not itself moral. A story will make it clear why this is so. Brown is a sadist and serial killer. His sadism and wish to hurt others is surpassed only by his wish to save his own skin. Brown is drafted into the military during wartime. He is put to work as an interrogator, torturer, and executioner. He doesn’t know whether he’s serving the interests of justice in discharging his professional responsibilities, and were he to find out that he was not, that would only enhance his love of his job. As it happens, a successful job-performance on Brown’s part will have very positive consequences not just for his fellow citizens but for the world in general. His country is a liberal, tolerant, peaceful democracy. It was invaded by a totalitarian, intolerant nation whose intention is to reduce the citizens of every country besides its own to a condition of slavery. For this reason, if Brown’s country were to lose the war, humanity would revert to a condition of barbarism. And because of the particularly barbaric methods employed by the invading country, Brown’s nation is itself forced to act barbarically in order to protect itself. Therefore, sadly, Brown’s country, and people the world over, need Brown to do his job and do it well. And he does. But Brown’s excellent job performance is fueled by hate and ill-will, not by a love of justice. Brown wants to hurt people, and his job is the only outlet he has for this urge. Brown’s love of his work would diminish were he to find out that it improved the human condition, and that love would become more intense were he to find out that it worsened it. In doing his job, Brown isn’t acting in a morally meritorious fashion, the reason being that his conduct isn’t driven by a desire to do the right thing. Brown is acting morally only in...",

They don’t simply feel good; they aren’t experiencing the fake happiness that comes with self-deception and cheap pleasures. They are authentically, integratedly happy. 2.0 Why it’s to one’s advantage to be moral Given these facts, the obvious judgment to make is that morality is not inherent in happiness. But such a judgment would be a shallow one. Being happy consists, at least in part, in judging that one’s life conforms to some ideal that one has and, therefore, that it is in compliance with some value. Happiness isn’t so much a feeling as it is a conviction that how one is coincides with how, relative to some value system or other, one should be. Thus, the concept of happiness must be understood at least partly in valuative terms. It is a moral concept. There is happiness only where there is an enduring psychological subject—a mere body is not enough. There is an enduring subject only where there is a certain degree of self-consciousness.1 More specifically, for there to be a subject—what Harry Frankfurt refers to as a person—there must be an alignment of higher-order desires with lower-order desires.2 You have a flabby, pitiful physique. If you go for a jog right now, you’ll trim down. If you eat a bucket of ice cream, you’ll flab out. You give into lassitude and eat the ice cream. You’re ashamed. The fact that you’re ashamed means that, in your own eyes, you’ve done something wrong. You’ve fallen short of an ideal. You’ve failed to live up to your own values, and you are thus unhappy. (In any case, you’re unhappy vis-à-vis this particular situation, though perhaps not in general.) To move forward, let’s modify the story just told. As before, you want a trim physique and are confronted with the same choice as before. But this time, you go for the jog. You are proud of yourself, and you’re also delighted at the fact that, thanks to your self-control, you are that much closer to your objective. You are happy (vis-à-vis this situation). Thus, it is only to the extent that a creature values things that it makes sense to describe it as happy or unhappy.

For starters, they aren’t sentient. Sentience is necessary for happiness. But it isn’t sufficient. Not all animate beings can be happy. Only animate beings meeting certain conditions have that privilege. Not all animate beings are subjects. The difference between animate beings that are subjects and those that are not is that the former, unlike the latter, are able to regulate their own lives according to values that they have. As we’ll see, a certain degree of self-consciousness is needed to meet this condition. We are inclined to think that non-human animals (e.g., cats, dogs, hamsters) are without values. This isn’t true. There are certain kinds of values that they lack that we have. But it is inherent in the very nature of subjecthood that its activity be value-driven. Cats, dogs, etc., are indeed subjects. (Not all animate creatures are subjects.) We’re also inclined to think that they are completely lacking in self-consciousness. This isn’t true. Echoing what we just said, there is an important kind of self-consciousness that we have that they lack. But in order for a series of mental states to have the cohesiveness needed to constitute a single mind, as opposed to a mere sequence of mental states, it is necessary that some of them embody some awareness of some of the others.

But none of these ecstasies embodies any intelligence, any connectedness to other life-forms, any connectedness to any ideals or values.

X feels good at time t1; it feels good again at time t2; and again at time t3; and so on. It may be that X feels good in different ways on all of these different occasions. Maybe at t1 it feels good in the way that somebody eating a delicious chocolate bar feels good. Maybe at time t2, it feels good in the way that stepping into a hot bath feels good. And so on.

But is there something that has that body, in the way that you have your body and I have mine? We must take care not to impute our mental states to X. When we feel pleasure, we don’t just feel pleasure. We put that feeling into a larger context. We think about where it came from; what it’s leading to; what it accompanies, how it bears on our objectives; whether we should feel guilty about it; whether it’s a healthy or an unhealthy development; whether other people can tell that we’re feeling it; whether, supposing it pleasurable, we’ll be able to recreate it; whether we’ll be able to recreate it without jeopardizing the welfare of people we care about (or who don’t care about but feel we have a moral obligation towards); etc. When we have an experience, even one we consider base or trivial, we look it at through the lens of a preexisting structure, formed partly on the basis of other experiences, and that experience may, in its turn, become a part of such a structure. If it’s exceptionally (un)pleasant, we’ll try to remember what caused it so as to (not) recreate it. Our mental lives are therefore cumulative; and inherent in this cumulativeness is a certain self-consciousness. It is sometimes said that only human beings are self-conscious.

Because dogs and cats aren’t as good at we are at thinking abstractly, what they know is much more tightly tethered to their perceptual experiences than what we know is tethered to ours. But their psychological lives don’t consist of mutually disconnected, isolated mental episodes. Like us, they learn, develop attitudes, and have desires. And, possibly, they even have objectives. But none of this holds of X. In X’s case, one state is followed by another; and that one is followed by a third; and so on indefinitely.

(Let M6 be this belief and let B6 be the brain-entity identical therewith.) In this case, my belief that Max has four cars brings about my belief that Max has more than two cars, and—what is different, as we have seen—my believing that Max has four cars brings about my believing that Max has more than two cars. But there’s more to it than that. It wasn’t in some haphazard or unprincipled way that my believing the one thing led to my believing the other. My believing that Max has four cars could have led to a jealousyinduced psychotic break during which I had hallucinations of Max showing me the titles to three cars of his. For argument’s sake, let’s suppose that, on the basis of those hallucinations, I believed that Max had more than two cars. Under those circumstances, my (pre-hallucination) belief that Max had four cars would indeed have led to my belief that Max has more than two cars.

In actuality I knew that Max had four cars and, driven by an understanding of the implications of the fact, I rightly inferred that Max must have more than two cars. That transition was norm-driven. I recognized that Max must have more than two cars, given that he has four; it was by way of this recognition that M1 brought about M2, this being why that transition was norm-driven. People make invalid inferences of course. But those are norm-driven. (They’re driven by the wrong norms.) I believe that all dogs are mammals and invalidly infer from this that all mammals are dogs.

Thus, where there are no content-driven reactions, no mental state has anything to do with any other. Mental states cohere, and form a single subject, only if some of them are content-driven responses to others. This means that there are subjects only where there are content-driven and therefore norm-driven reactions. So norm-drivenness is the essence of subjecthood. The essence of subjecthood is thus a concern for what ought to be the case. “But the ‘ought’ in question surely isn’t a moral ought.” Why not? “Because legitimate inferences—i.e., inferences that embody due regard for the appropriate norms—can be made for purely self-interested reasons. One can use one’s mathematical skill to steal money, etc.” There’s no denying that profoundly evil people can be very intelligent. But we’ll see that norm-drivenness in the moral sense is to be understood in terms of narrower form of norm-drivenness that we’ve seen to be constitutive of subjecthood. One last point: Isn’t my aversion to eating cow brains purely an emotional or instinctual reacting to my unpleasant dining experience? Yes—but only because instinctual and emotional reactions are norm-driven. The difference between a “cool, logical reaction” and “a subjective, emotion-driven reaction” isn’t that the latter isn’t norm-driven, whereas the former is; it’s that the latter is driven by a norm that, were one not blinded by passion, one would question. If, driven by fear and hate, Smith decides that Larry must be dangerous, the reason being that Larry has the same hair color as Larry’s evil brother-in-law, Larry’s emotion-driven reaction is norm-driven. The problem is that the norm isn’t a good one. A reaction that isn’t driven by any norm isn’t prejudiced, the reason being that prejudice is acceptance of illegitimate norms. If a reaction is emotional and otherwise ‘irrational’, it is for that very reason, norm-driven. (I put “irrational” in scare-quotes since I don’t believe that emotional reactions are necessarily irrational ones. They can be irrational, of course.5 But emotions can give one conscious access to insights that would otherwise be submerged in one’s unconscious. See Chapter 20.)",

Designing tea-cozies does have value—but not in that context. Novel-writing does have value—but not in the context of a war of all against all. It might be said that, in such a context, novel writing would have value, but that, for obvious reasons, people would fail to see it—they’d be too absorbed in the business of surviving. While I grant that this position has merit, I would like to register a reservation that I have about it. People who write novels are, in so doing, reaching out to others. People do not, ultimately, write novels only for their own amusement. Of course, people sometimes write books that they know no one besides them will ever see. I myself have written two or three such books. But I wrote them because I knew that I needed to write them in order to develop the skills needed to write books that others might find worthwhile to read. The novelists that I know or have known of have all written a few early works that they never expected to publish. But they wrote them with the intention of writing other works that would be read by others. It may be that Beethoven was a very self-involved person. But in composing music, he wasn’t just talking to himself. He was addressing an audience. He may have thought that his contemporaries weren’t the right audience—that it would take a few years for humanity to catch up to his music. But he was writing it in anticipation of some future audience that would understand it.",

In general, a certain morality of duty is inherent in any case of self-censure. Thus, embodied in any case of self-censure is compliance with a certain morality of duty. So far as one is censuring oneself, one’s attitude is: “I’m just another person; and, just like others, I have to be judged for my failures.” This attitude is the essence of the morality of duty. Thus, a compliance with a certain morality of duty is inherent in any case of flourishing. Having a conscience is about holding oneself to standards; it’s about stepping back from oneself, judging oneself dispassionately and, depending on the verdict, castigating or rewarding oneself accordingly. Psychopaths don’t hold themselves to objective standards. When they fail, they don’t blame themselves; they blame circumstances. When evil, non-psychopaths fail, they admit it and make the needed changes to themselves. Psychopaths are so self-indulgent that they don’t do what they have to do to succeed. Unlike evil non-psychopaths, they don’t even hold themselves to the nefarious ideals embedded in their projects, that being why their successes are confined to small cons and other such trivialities. But the successes of psychopaths—as distinguished from profoundly evil, non-psychopaths (e.g., Stalin)—are, in the big scheme of things, very minor. For this reason, history’s great villains tend not to be psychopaths. Psychopaths are so bereft of morality that they don’t have the self-discipline to get to positions of real power.",

Both are rooted in a wish to adhere to a code of behavior that is larger than oneself and to which each human is supposedly accountable. Thus, the self-recriminations of an evil non-psychopath have a basis in a wish to comply with a morality of duty, albeit one that others might (claim to) hold in contempt. And given that the ability to self-censure, and change oneself in light of one’s self-censures, underlies all cases of non-trivial flourishing, in both the evil and the good alike, it follows that a wish to comply with a morality of duty underlies, and is essential to, any case of flourishing. 6.0 How differences in people’s views concerning flourishing mask underlying moral agreement Not all people have the same moral values; not all cultures have the same moral values. Given this, it might seem as though I’m imposing my own idiosyncratic conception of morality on the rest of humanity by saying that excellence is flourishing and, consequently, that one is acting rightly insofar as, and only insofar as, one is acting in a flourishing-conducive way. What about people who believe that to be good is to obey God’s will? Or those who identify goodness with fidelity to one’s country? Or those who identify it with adherence to the Marine code of conduct? Or those who have some other view? Am I not simply dismissing these various different conceptions of morality, all of them reasonable, in saying that moral goodness is (the promotion of) flourishing? In identifying goodness with flourishing and the promotion thereof, I am not mistaking my personal idiosyncrasies for moral universals; nor am I saying anything inconsistent with anyone’s moral practices or beliefs. The differences in moral outlook between people and cultures have to do with differences in their views as to what constitutes flourishing. Nobody thinks that flourishing is bad or that its frustration is good, but people disagree as to what it is to flourish. Some people think it involves connectedness to the ways of one’s ancestors and, thus, in fidelity to tradition; others that it consists in breadth and intensity of awareness; others that it consists in having harmonious relations with others; others that it consists in submission to God’s will; others that it consists in...",

This individual convincingly explained how psychopaths are, in fact, highly empathic—that, were they not hyper-empathic, they would be much less adept at manipulating people than they in fact are. Much of what I have to say on the topic of psychopathy I learned from conversations with this person, whose points have been borne out by my research into this topic and also by my, I am sorry to say, extensive personal experience with these fauxbrethren of ours.) Assuming that you are not a psychopath (which you are probably not, since psychopaths don’t value learning for its own sake), your conscience is exercising a constant pressure on you. That doesn’t mean you can’t perform bad acts. Non-psychopaths can be exquisitely evil, as we’ve already noted. It means that you are always under the watchful eye of a standard-bearer. Oftentimes people of conscience perform evil acts in order to rebel against their consciences. And sometimes, wanting to appease their own overly brutal consciences, non-psychopaths perform bad acts in order to provoke authority figures to punish them, as Freud pointed out in his paper “Criminals from a sense of guilt.” But psychopaths don’t labor under the watchful eye of a censorious superego. Their condition may sound enviable. It is not. Because of their lack of conscience, they grossly under-perform. A psychopath who, given his intellectual level, could be a head of state or a great novelist, ends up being a two-bit con-man. Also, on the rare occasions when they’re sincere about their condition, psychopaths describe their lives as being cold and empty. (Which, presumably, is why they are constantly in need of petty forms of stimulation, as Robert Hare points out in his (1999) book Without Conscience.) They describe themselves as having no selves at all, and wishing that they did have selves.

CI2 doesn’t need much of an explanation. It’s obviously wrong to undermine another person’s autonomy. And, although it may well be right to undermine one person’s autonomy to preserve the autonomy of a million others, that doesn’t really redound to the discredit of CI2. The idea behind CI2 is that, given any bad act x, if everybody did x, nobody could successfully pull x off. It be pointless to lie in a world where everybody lied, since nobody would believe anybody. It would be pointless to try to steal in a world where everyone was a thief, since everyone would go out of their way to make their possessions utterly theft-proof.

One can see why one would think this. In a world where everyone was constantly trying to con (or otherwise use) everyone, everyone would be on their guard, making it impossible, so one might infer, for anyone to con (or otherwise use) anyone.

You obviously did the right thing. Lost money can be regained. Lost life cannot. You don’t regret making this choice. But you do regret having to make it. Smith is a good guy, and you really wish you hadn’t had to steal from him. Does this scenario show that there are exceptions to the principles that stealing is wrong? No.4 Stealing from Smith is the lesser of two evils. It’s obvious that, under the circumstances, the right thing to do was to steal the money. But in some cases the “right” thing to do is merely the least wrong thing to do; and this is one of those cases. Thus, the principle that stealing is wrong does hold categorically. But this doesn’t mean that you should never steal. What it means is that, although you have an obligation—a categorical obligation—not to steal, you have an even stronger obligation not to let your children die. A moral principle outweighed is not a moral principle extinguished. There are many categorical moral obligations. Lying, cheating, stealing, manipulating, wounding—these are all bad things. They are things that are categorically bad. But oftentimes these bad things are the lesser of two evils. Torture is wrong. But it’s more wrong to allow a nuclear device to be detonated in the middle of a city. The circumstances being what they are, torturing one person may be far less wrong than the alternative (namely, letting many innocents die). Suppose that, by virtue of the fact that you had to steal from Smith to save your children, you ceased to have any obligation not to steal from Smith. In that case, any remorse you felt as a result of stealing from him would have no objective basis. It would be the emotional counterpart of a hallucination. But, under the circumstances, it would be monstrous of you to feel no remorse at stealing from Smith. Of course, your choosing not to steal from him would have been far more monstrous, that being why, under the circumstances, the right thing to do was to steal. That said, it’s appropriate that you feel some remorse at having depleted Smith’s lifesavings. The reason for this is that, even though your obligation to save...",

Sincerely intending to save the children, you feed them X, which is lethal, genuinely believing that it’s Y, which is nutritious. But in and of itself your intention to do good is utterly beyond reproach. But anything other than an intention to do good can be bad. A cool-headed, intelligent villain is that much more diabolical than a hysterical, unintelligent one. A wealthy, healthy villain is that much worse than a poor, sickly one. It is only if good people have them that intelligence, self-control, wealth, and health are good things. This means that those things are not inherently good. There is ultimately but one moral law, namely: respect other people’s autonomy. It follows that anything other than an intention to treat people as subjects, as opposed to objects, lacks any inherent moral worth. It might be that, unless lobotomized, a certain villain will use his formidable cognitive powers to do harm. But surely lobotomizing someone is, at best, the lesser of two evils. This shows that, although a villain’s intelligence is inherently good, the existence of that inherent good may be incompatible with the some other, far greater inherent good. If, supposing that he isn’t lobotomized, that criminal will kill millions of people, many of them intelligent, than one inherent good—saving the lives, and a fortiori the intellects, of millions of people—outweighs some other inherent good—preserving the intellect of some one person. Imagine the following. Brown is a happy two year old infant. Brown didn’t have to work for his happiness. He just happens to be happy. Question: Does Brown’s happiness have moral value? Yes. Obviously. That’s why it would be wrong to make Brown unhappy. Second question: Does Brown deserve praise for being happy? No. His happiness, though morally good, isn’t commendable. Many things that are morally good are not commendable. This point is clarified and defended in Chapter 19, Sections 3.0–4.0. In addition to being false, Kant’s position is self-undermining. It would make no sense at all to say (a) that autonomy isn’t inherently good, while also saying (b) that an intention to respect autonomy is inherently good. So if Kant is right to think it inherently good to intend to respect autonomy, then autonomy must itself be inherently good. But in...",

Couldn’t one learn all the relevant logical norms, and make a decision not to comply with them in one’s thinking? To be sure, it isn’t likely that one would do this. But isn’t it at least a theoretical possibility? And given that it is, doesn’t it follow that your definition of “rationality” is wrong?” In order to carry out such a program, one’s thinking would have to be rational. In any given situation, one would, by the objector’s own terms, (a) have to figure out what the rational thing to think was, and (b) decide not to think it. And the first part, at least, would involve being rational. The second part, admittedly, wouldn’t be rational—if one knows that the right conclusion to draw is Q, but one infers not-Q instead, one isn’t being rational. But in the case of the person just described, that irrationality would be parasitic on an existing rationality. Also, if somebody knowingly draws the wrong inference, one is “irrational” in a different way from somebody who fails to see what the right inference is to begin with. The second sort of irrationality is purely cognitive. The first has to do with the relationship between cognition and action. The one has to do with what philosophers sometimes refer to as theoretical reason; the other has to do with what philosophers call practical reason. Theoretical reason has to do only with the drawing of inferences; it has nothing to do with the choices that one makes on the basis of one’s inferences. The degree to which one is “theoretically reasonable” is a function only of the degree to which one draws the right inferences, it being irrelevant what one decides to do on the basis of those inferences. Practical reason has to do with the relationship between the inferences one draws, on the one hand, and the intentions in which they eventuate, on the other.8 Given this, suppose that Smith decides to live the sort of life described by the objector.

No matter how you slice it, rationality is intellectual autonomy. In other words, to be rational is to decide for oneself how to think. Let’s compare rationality with autonomy. To be autonomous, I have said, is to live as one chooses. One’s being autonomous, I propose, is the same thing as one’s deciding what to do on the basis of norms that one has adopted. A good way to see why this is (I believe) the right approach is to consider an obvious objection to it: (NSG9) Your analysis is definitely wrong. Consider the case of Williams. Williams has decided that he’ll do whatever he wants to do. He won’t examine his actions, or the intentions behind them, in light of norms. He’ll just act. But he’s autonomous. That’s a datum. After all, he’s deciding for himself how to live. Here’s why this is off the mark. To the extent that Smith carries out his agenda, he isn’t deciding anything at all. True—it is indeed a decision on his part that initiates his entry into a life of the sort described (viz. one in which he just does what he wants, never bothering to assess the consistency of his desires with norms of any sort). But once he’s in that life, he isn’t choosing anything at all. A creature that doesn’t deliberate doesn’t decide anything. It just acts.

(The dog intends to get to the ball before the other dog. That’s why it’s running so frantically.) But it seems wrong to say that dogs “choose” (or “decide”). Dogs don’t deliberate. They just react. The dog sees red meat: he pounces on it. He sees his brutal master: he cringes. The dog’s life is a series of programmed and therefore compulsive reactions to immediate stimuli. The dog doesn’t call the shots; these hardwired reaction protocols call the shots for him, and it therefore doesn’t make choices. Only creatures that deliberate make choices.

It’s intentions result from a convergence of factors (its innate and acquired psychological and physiological structure, its past experiences, the present context). But it doesn’t form them. Its intentions are formed in an impersonal way. An autonomous being forms its own intentions. So an autonomous being is responsible for its intentions and, therefore, for the acts to which they lead. By contrast, a sub-rational, non-autonomous creature is responsible only for its actions. The intentions of a non-autonomous creatures are not the results of agency. Agency, for the non-autonomous, begins with intentions, but doesn’t itself generate them. For the autonomous, on the other hand, agency is itself responsible for intentions. Words like “agent,” “agency,” etc. are ambiguous; and words like “subject” (as in, “he is a human subject”) are correspondingly ambiguous. In one sense, dogs and infants are agents. In another, they are not. Which is why we don’t hold 3-year olds criminally responsible for their acts. Two-year olds are agents in a sense of the word, but not in the same, robust sense in which you and I are agents. Words like “subject” (as in, “he is a human subject”) are correspondingly ambiguous. For the reasons just given, agency in this more robust sense is identical with rationality and, therefore, with autonomy; and agency in this sense is identical with moral responsibility. Respect for a person’s autonomy is therefore nothing other than respect for his agency and thus for his very existence, to the extent as he is, in the robust sense of the word, a subject. Contrary to what Kant tries to show, none of this entails that one’s own welfare necessarily involves one’s respecting other people’s autonomy (rationality/agency/subjecthood). But it shows that one’s welfare depends on, if it isn’t identical with, one’s being moral to oneself—on one’s not encroaching on one’s own autonomy. It also shows that ethical responsibility and agency are coeval with rationality and autonomy. In any case, Kant’s attempt to identify morality with self-interest, though not itself a success, is driven by a cogent analysis of the nature of agency and its connection to rationality and morality.

It is one’s sole intention in performing any given act to benefit from that act. The expected benefit may be simple pleasure or it may be an authentic enhancement of self. The problems with psychological egoism are similar to the problems with psychological hedonism. It was in Beethoven’s self-interest to compose music only because composing music itself has value. If Beethoven didn’t recognize the value of composing music, he wouldn’t have seen it as being in his interest to do so. Although we’re obviously egocentric, our egocentrism isn’t as morally empty as we’re inclined to think. If you don’t see value in being on the Supreme Court, being on it wouldn’t mean anything to you, and you wouldn’t see it as being in your interest to be on it. Thus, psychological egoism isn’t a viable doctrine. Also, there are well-known counterexamples to psychological egoism. There are people (e.g., Mother Teresa) who don’t seem to be acting in their own interest, and do seem to be acting almost entirely in the interests of others. Advocates of psychological egoism deal with such cases by saying that Mother Teresa did these things because they made her feel good and that in doing them she was therefore acting in a purely self-interested fashion. This position isn’t tenable. Mother Teresa wouldn’t have enjoyed doing these things unless she saw them as valuable. She did them because she saw that they were valuable, and because they were valuable, her doing them made her feel good. But that is very different from saying that she did them in order to feel good. (See the previous section for clarification of this point.) What we said a moment ago concerning Mother Teresa shows that ethical egoism is false. She helped people not because it was in her interest, but because she saw value in it. Of course, given that she structured her life around that value, it came to be in her interest to help people. And had Mother Teresa gone into investment-banking, it would have become in her interest to become a good investment-banker.

Presumably not (for the same reason as last time). These two stories suggest that there are cases where, no matter how much good comes of some act, that act is still just wrong. If these two stories are representative, acts that fall into this category involve cases of autonomy violation. This, of course, substantiates Kant’s position that goodness = autonomy promotion and that badness = heteronomy promotion. Kant was a virulent opponent of utilitarianism. There are other problems with utilitarianism. I’ll focus on what I think are the most important ones. First, if everyone were always trying to maximize the welfare of others, everybody would be miserable, since no one would be doing what he wanted. Second, utilitarianism says that anything that isn’t an act of trying to help everyone has no value and that an act has value only to the extent that it helps others. If this is right, then reading a book or listening to a good piano sonata has value only to the extent that it helps others. Third, utilitarianism can’t accommodate the fact that personal loyalties have moral value. Given a choice between saving a stranger and saving your devoted spouse of 50 years, you should save the stranger if, by doing so, you stand to make people even infinitesimally better off than you do by saving your wife. But that seems positively monstrous. Fourth, if everybody were trying to make the world a better place with every single act, the world would quickly become a very bad place. For example, if judges broke the rules in order to serve the interests of justice, the legal system would collapse, and all the protections it provides would be withdrawn.",

And the fact that it was unpredictable would lead to regressive social changes of many kinds.)

So do your duty. Don’t play God. The differences in viewpoint between the consequentialist and the deontologist concern how to create a moral world, not what a moral world is; and they therefore don’t disagree with each other as to the nature of morality. The deontologist’s position, as represented here, is similar to that of the rule-utilitarian, and the consequentialist’s position is similar to that of the act-utilitarian. Given that utilitarianism is generally seen as a paradigm case of a consequentialist doctrine, it might seem that I must have misrepresented deontology. But the right conclusion to draw, I would submit, is that, just as I suggested, the deontologist and consequentialist don’t disagree as much as they think they do. ENDNOTES",

Not knowing how to describe their views, they say that they’re “hedonists” (or “nihilists” or some such), when, in fact, they’re nothing of the sort.

For exactly similar reasons, the fact that kind acts are morally right is what makes God like them. Therefore, it isn’t God’s approval of such acts that makes them right. Conclusion: Morality is independent of God’s views. If, as many of us believe, God is morally perfect and intellectually infallible, then God will like all morally good acts and dislike all morally bad ones. But it isn’t God’s liking an act that makes it good or bad. That act is good or bad all by itself. Question: Could God make rape to be morally good? No. Even God cannot make rape be good. But can’t God do anything? So can’t he make rape morally good? No, and the reasons are similar to those that make God unable to make a square circle. For an elucidation and defense of this point, see Section 4.0. 2.1 Why, even if correct, the Divine Command Theory is irrelevant to what even maximally religious people believe Many a sociopathic ghoul has claimed that “God” ordered him to kill. We don’t believe such people. But why not? (In this context, it will be assumed for argument’s sake that we believe there to be a God and also that we believe God to be morally good.) One reason is that what the ghoul in question is claiming is inconsistent with our views about morality. “God would have to be evil to tell Hitler to do those things,” we believe. “Therefore, contrary to what Hitler claimed, God didn’t tell Hitler to do those things.” Of course, there are often other reasons to distrust such people. There is independent evidence of mental illness or of political ambition or of some other factor that would explain why, even though God did not speak to him, the evil-doer in question would say otherwise. That said, if some otherwise utterly normal person were to tell you that God told him to blow up a school bus, you would, for that very reason, question the credibility of his claim. This shows that even if God speaks to certain individuals, it isn’t because of what He told them that we believe that rape, theft, and so on, are wrong.

It follows that a precondition for a thing’s being described as existent or non-existent is its existing. This means that, if P is the proposition one affirms when one describes a given object as existent, there is no negation of P. Since any given proposition can be negated, it follows that, in attributing existence to a given thing, one isn’t affirming anything.

(Indeed, Theroux used that very expression to make a point not unlike ours, and Theroux is sometimes seen as one of the first existentialists.) Why do traditional values so often demand a reduction of the self? One possible answer is that the values that are endorsed by society are those that are good for society, and therefore aren’t necessarily those that are good for the individual. As Freud emphasized in Civilization and its Discontents, society is possible only if the aspirations of individuals are abridged: a precondition for civilization is the abridgment of human freedoms and, consequently, of gratifications. A related point—one that presupposes a rather dark conception of human nature and may therefore meet with some resistance—is that the values that society asks the individual to accept embody much of the antagonism that people have for one another. People’s lives often aren’t what they want to them to be, and the values that people impose on one another (e.g., “be a team player,” “it’s not about what you want; it’s about what’s right for the family”) often express their desire to prevent others from superseding them. If you see values as yours to accept or reject, you are less likely to be duped by moralistic propaganda into reducing yourself, and your life is more likely to follow the path that it should take, as opposed to the one that others want it to take. In any case, that is the idea—and I’m pretty sure that there is at least some truth to it. 2.0 Existentialism doctrinalized So far so good. Given only what we’ve said, existentialism seems to be viable. But several problems arise. Although existentialism is not merely a doctrine—although it is fundamentally an attitude, as opposed to a belief-system—existentialist philosophers have spent a great deal of time producing doctrines (belief-systems) that validate the attitude in question. Even though that attitude may be salutary, it doesn’t follow that those doctrines are correct or even coherent. Since we are concerned with existentialist philosophy—that is, with the efforts of existentialist philosophers to provide a rational foundation for the attitude that we’ve been discussing—we have to assess whether those doctrines are any good.

In that case, given our emotional architecture, we cannot accept just any value system and still be happy. This doesn’t mean that all people have the same values—clearly they don’t. But what it means (or at least suggests) is that the range of admissible value systems is limited by immutable facts about our psychology (and biology). 4.1 Morality and language compared Obviously there are different viable languages—in fact, infinitely many different (possible) viable languages. But Chomsky showed that any humanly learnable language satisfies rather narrowly defined formal constraints. And, as Chomsky points out, this strongly suggests that the range of languages that are viable (for humans) is set by innate facts about our psychological-biological structure—that we are “hardwired” to learn languages that have certain basic structural properties. Similarly, even though it is obvious that not all people have the same values, the range of psychologically (and biologically) admissible values is limited. (This doesn’t mean that there are a finite number of specific admissible values—it means that there are a finite number of kinds of admissible values.) It thus seems that (B) is false; for it doesn’t seem correct to say that your innate psychological structure puts no limits on what kind of value system you can happily accept. A stronger point seems to be warranted. If, as we’ve been arguing, a value system (or, possibly, a plurality of value systems) is internal to your emotional architecture, then there are limits not only to what kinds of value systems you can happily accept, but to what you kinds of value systems you can accept at all. Presumably, you cannot change (except within fairly narrow limits) how you emotionally react to situations. So supposing that, as we’ve been arguing, you can change your value system only by changing your emotional architecture, then you cannot (except in trivial respects) change your value system at all. Of course, you can, in terms of your overt behavior, comply with a value system that doesn’t make you happy.

Stalin failed as a head of government precisely because he did not serve the interests of his constituents. It follows that the objective of the Soviet government was to serve the interests of its constituents—even though that may not have been the objective of Stalin or of any of the other senior officials composing that government.

If the judge rules that the money is not Smith’s, then the bank manager is acting illegally if he does give Smith the key. The judge may or may not make his decision on the basis of a moral principle. In either case, the law is what the judge says it is. This is the antithesis of the idea that there is any necessary relationship between law and morality, even though it is obviously compatible with the idea that the two may sometimes overlap. We’ve already seen why law is to be understood in terms of morality, notwithstanding that Dworkin’s argument for this conclusion is less than cogent. But if our criticism of Dworkin is correct, it seems to follow the legal interpretation (so-called) is mere legislation, and thus isn’t interpretation at all. But legal interpretation is not mere legislation, and this is perfectly compatible with the fact that the law is what the judge says it is. A brief detour through the history of science may help to indicate the broader outlines of my argument for this. The layperson’s concept of temperature has no application outside of what are, from a physicist’s viewpoint, extremely narrow horizons. When physicists identified heat with molecular motion, they were not identifying the content of the layperson’s concept of temperature. Rather, they were replacing the lay-person’s concept with one that is consistent with it, within its narrow sphere of applicability, but is more precisely defined and also has a much wider sphere of application. Such principled extensions of existing concepts are referred to as “delineations” or “precisifications.” Any judicial ruling is ipso facto an extension, not an identification, of existing law. But judicial rulings are principled extensions of the law—that is, they are delineations of it, and are not cases of law being created out of whole cloth. Just as some delineations of the concept of temperature (“a body’s temperature is the sum of the velocities of its constituent molecules divided by the number of those particles”) are truer to pre-theoretic data than others (“heat is dephlogistinated matter”), so some interpretations of law are truer to existing law than others. Blackstone said that judges identify, and do not create, law. John Austin described Blackstone’s position as a “childish fiction.” Given the argument just outlined—and, in fact,...",

I infer that Larry stole my credit cards (etc.) because the relevant data is easy to explain on the assumption that he did, the reason being that his doing so would have generated that data, and hard to explain on the assumption that he didn’t, the reason being that it’s unclear what else could have generated that data.

In some cases, the conclusions of inferences to the best explanation aren’t themselves causal statements. Our knowledge that water consists of H2O molecules isn’t itself a causal statement. Cause-effect relations hold between distinct entities (e.g., thunder and lightning). Water and H2O aren’t distinct.

(1) and (5) have different meanings. (5) doesn’t say that snow is white. Nor does it say that grass is green. It says that if it’s the case that both grass is green and snow is white, then it’s also the case that grass is green. (4), on the other hand, says (among other things) that snow is white. So (4) is false in universes where snow is green. But (5) is true in such universes. (In fact, (5) is true in every possible universe.) Since there are circumstances where (4) is false but (5) is true, they don’t have the same meanings.Modern symbolic logic gives us a way of avoiding the laborious ad hoc methods just used to disambiguate (3). To express (5), we say: (3.5) (snow is white and grass is green)→grass is green. And to express (4), we say: (3.4) snow is white and (grass is green→grass is green). In general, any two co-parenthetical sentences are more tightly bonded to each other than either is to anything that isn’t co-parenthetical with those sentences. Negation: ~P is the negation of P. Thus, “~(snow is not white)” is the negation of “snow is white.” This means that “~(snow is not white)” says the same thing as “it is not the case that snow is white.” “~(snow is not white)” doesn’t say that snow is black; nor does it say that snow is green. It says only that snow isn’t white; everything else is left open. The negation of a sentence isn’t the same thing as the “opposite” of that sentence.

The result of this operation is: (%1) “it is not the case that if John likes to listen to Mozart, then Larry likes to listen to Brahms or the sky is blue.” But there’s a problem.

Such Herculean measures shouldn’t have been necessary, given that the objective was only to perform a purely grammatical operation. This problem doesn’t arise in our special symbolic notation. % can be unambiguously disambiguated in a mechanical, thought-free manner.

Thus, the converse of “if Bob is a human, then Bob is a mammal” is “if Bob is a mammal, then Bob is human.” As this example shows, statements are not generally equivalent with their converses. It’s only when both antecedent and consequent are equivalent that a given conditional is equivalent with its converse. (In (P→Q), P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent.) Thus, the converse of “if Bob is a father then Bob is a male parent is true” is true, since antecedent and consequence are equivalent. The inverse of (P→Q) is (not-P→not-Q). Thus, the inverse of “if Bob is a human, then Bob is a mammal” is “if Bob is not a human, then Bob is not a mammal.” As this example shows, statements are not generally equivalent with their inverses. It’s only when both antecedent and consequent are equivalent that conditional is equivalent with its inverse. This is because the converse of a proposition is equivalent with its inverse. In other words, (Q→P)↔(not-P→not-Q). The reason why they’re equivalent is that the second is the contrapositive of the first. (As we know, contraposing a conditional produces an equivalent conditional.) A sentence-level operation is truth-preserving if, when given a true sentence as input, it cannot possibly yield a false sentence as output. Contraposition is truth-preserving. Conversion and inversion are not. Exercise: Prove that, given any conditional sentence S, the contrapositive of S is equivalent with S.

This is the view of Peter Strawson, Jon Barwise, and John Perry.4 But, for the sake of brevity, we’ll use the term ‘sentence’ to stand for sentence-type and sentence-tokens. Modality: “Modal” means “having to do with necessity or possibility.” Possibility and necessity are properties of statements, not objects. Any statement of the form □P (‘it’s necessarily the case that P’) or P (‘it’s possibly the case that P’) is a modal statement. “Necessary” and “possible” are interdefinable. “Necessary” can be defined as “not possibly not,” and “possibly” can be defined as “not necessarily not.” Thus, □P iff ~~Q.5 Statements that affirm bearing relations, whether deductive or inductive, are modal. Thus, causal statements are modal statements, since they have the form “□(if P, then Q).” Causal necessity isn’t logical necessity, of course. Given that (i) I threw gasoline on the fire, it is causally necessary that (ii) the fire flared up. But (ii) isn’t a logical consequence of (i).

So even though, technically, each entails the other, there is no significant sense in which the one can be inferred from the other—no sense in which a knowledge of the one yields a knowledge of the other. Of course, somebody who knows that 1 + 1 = 2 will probably also know that triangles have three sides, but he won’t know the one on the basis of the other. By contrast, somebody who knows that x is a case of true belief could potentially know that on the basis of the fact that x is knowledge. Commentary Model-theoretic entailment is an over-valued notion that doesn’t correspond at all well to the conception of entailment embodied in our inferential practices. Nonetheless, because, in the early ‘60’s, some branches of philosophy were (wrongly) thought to be successfully assimilated to a branch of mathematics known as “model theory”—the purpose of this branch being to study model-theoretic entailment—philosophers now tend to treat model-theoretic entailment as the fundamental kind of entailment—when, for the reasons just stated, it is in fact an entirely artificial notion. Model-theoretic entailment isn’t really a kind of entailment. It is a theory of entailment. Like other scientists, logicians model data. Where logic is concerned, the data in question are our intuitions concerning bearing-relations—they are to the effect that certain things entail (the negations of) certain other things. We know intuitively that (K1) “x is knowledge” entails (K2) “x is a true belief.” Logicians want to make it clear what it is that we know in knowing this; they want to make it clear what it is for the one statement to entail the second. Here is the proposal that they came up with: (MT10) for P to entail Q is for there to be no possible circumstance in which the first is true and the second is false. Why did logicians choose MT when trying to model our intuitions concerning entailment? Because MT is extensionally correct. In other words, for any statements P and Q, P entails Q iff there is no possible circumstance where P is true and Q is false. But even though there are no counter-examples to it, MT is false.

    "text": "(P) the interior angles of a Euclidean triangle add up to 180°. This is all very well. But it’s patently obvious that you can’t infer the truth of P from that of Q, or vice versa. In general, model-theoretical entailment is inferentially useless. A precondition for knowing that P entails Q is that you know, first, that P cannot be false and, second that Q cannot be false. But if you know this, there’s no need to infer the one from the other. What this shows is that knowledge of model-theoretic entailments are parasitic on some other, much more fundamental sort of entailment. And what this shows is that knowledge of model-theoretic entailments have no significant role in the thought-processes of any possible cogitator. Unlike model theoretic entailment, formal entailment isn’t inferentially useless. But our ability to make formal inferences is parasitic on our ability to make informal inferences. Actually, so-called “formal” inferences are informal ones. Formal entailment is a relation that holds between expressions (more specifically, sentences or sentence-tokens). This means that we have to know what sentences mean to make inferences that are licensed by formal entailments. To infer (S1) “snow is white” from (S2) “snow is white and grass is green,” I have to know what those two sentences mean, at least up to a point. I have to know that “and” doesn’t mean what is in fact meant by “or.” I also have to know that “snow is white” and “grass is green” are complete sentences—that they aren’t drivel, like “bunga berka der.” So in order to infer S1 from S2, I have to know the truth of some proposition of the form: (S3) given that S2 means such and such and that S1 means thus and such, it follows that S1 is true, given that S2 is true. But S3 is not formally true. First of all, it’s a proposition, not a sentence. But even the corresponding sentence (the result of putting the verbiage in question in quotation marks) isn’t formally true. It’s an analytic, logical, informal truth.

Suppose that your reason for accepting (3) is that, given your understanding of the concept expressed by “if...then...,” you know that it would be absurd to deny (3). In that case, your acceptance of (3) is based on your knowledge that, the structure of that concept being what it is, any proposition of that form must be true.

There’s nothing mystifying about this sort of vagueness. Symbols have the meanings we give them. If we decide that Px is true if x is 1, 2, or 3, and false if x is 4, 5, or 6 then ‹P7› isn’t true and neither is ‹not-P7.› But this isn’t because there is some proposition that is neither true nor false. It’s because, given how P has been defined, ‹P7› doesn’t encode a proposition and neither does ‹not-P7.› For a representation or symbol to be “vague” is simply for it to be under-defined. But what would it be for a symbol-meaning to be vague? But what would it be, for example, for a sentence-meaning (a proposition) to be vague? Propositions are individuated by their entailment-relations. In other words, a proposition’s identity is a function of what it entails and also of what entails it. If proposition P1 entails P2, but P3 does not, or P2 entails P1 but not P3, then P1 and P3 are ipso facto different propositions. Thus, the very idea of a proposition whose entailment-relations are indeterminate is a non-starter. This means that propositions always have determinate truth-conditions. After all, for proposition to have such and such truth-conditions is for such and such propositions to entail it. Thus, a proposition’s truth-conditions are either fulfilled or they aren’t. There is no other possibility. Thus, there are no indeterminate propositions, and the law of excluded middle (every proposition is either 100% true or 100% false) is correct. See “entailment,” “propositions.” Antecedent and consequent: In if P, then Q, P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent.

In fact, the forking of a river is a special cause of the branching out of a causal series. But for a river to fork is for it to become two rivers (supposing that the two tributaries don’t later merge). It isn’t for a river to become two independent streams of water.

When the waiter asks you what you would like to eat, you say “I’d like a bowl of clam chowder,” and not “I’d like a bowl of rotten entrails.” Why do you say “clam chowder” instead of “rotten entrails”? Because you know that, given what it is that you want, “rotten entrails” has the wrong meaning and “clam chowder” has the right meaning. Of course, how an expression is used is likely to change its meaning. If enough people use the word “restive” to mean tired, it may well come to have that meaning. But until that time comes, those people are misusing that expression; and their usage of it, being discrepant from its actual meaning, can’t possibly be constitutive of it. (II) Mere noises aren’t linguistic expressions. It is only noises coupled with meanings that are such expressions. In a world where there are no semantic conventions, a noise just like the noise you make when you say “snow is white” would mean nothing. If, in such a world, the gases leaving a volcano happened to make that noise, they would mean nothing. (In fact, they’d mean nothing in our world, except at most in some derivative sense.) Since, therefore, noises must be coupled with meanings in order to qualify as linguistic expressions, it makes no sense to say that what an expression means is a function of how it is used. After all, there is no expression to be used until the noises (and ink-marks and so forth) have been coupled with meanings. Therefore, CRS is false.Of course, there are different views as to what meanings are, and there are different views as to what it is for noises to be coupled with them. But relative to any such view, CRS is false. The contention that is closest to CRS that isn’t obviously false is the trivial contention that what noises (and ink-marks and the like) mean is a (partial) causal consequence of what people do with them. (This suggests that CRS is based on a failure to distinguish the concept of a logical consequence from that of a causal consequence.)",

If this weren’t the case, then nobody could ever utter a new sentence of English, at least not without making some ad hoc extension to the English language. But previously unuttered sentences are uttered all the time; and no sooner are they uttered than they have determinate meanings.According to CRS, what an expression means is determined by how it is used. So if CRS is right, an expression that hasn’t been used ipso facto has no meaning. To parry this, advocates of CRS would have to say the following. “Where some expressions are concerned, meaning is fixed by use. But where other expressions are concerned, use doesn’t fix meaning, at least not single-handedly. Some other factor is at work.” In making this concession, the advocate of CRS is admitting that CRS is false. Setting this aside, let us ask: what is this other factor? The answer: syntax. The meaning of “Bob kicked the can” is a function of (i) what each of its components means (in other words, it’s a function of what is meant by each of “Bob,” “kick,” and so on); and it’s also a function of (ii) the syntactic rules of English (in other words, it’s a function of the rules that assign meanings to complex expressions on the basis of the meanings of their constituents).",

If enough people thought that “Stalin the dictator of the Soviet Union from 1923–1953” entailed “somebody who was over 6 ft tall was the dictator of the Soviet Union from 1923–1953,” the former would entail the latter. But even if the latter were correct (which it isn’t since Stalin was barely over 5 ft tall), it wouldn’t follow from the first sentence.In their (2001) book The Compositionality Papers, Jerry Fodor and Ernie Lepore put forth several blistering criticisms of CRS. In that work, any gaps in the criticisms of CRS just put forth are very much filled in. Conditional: A conditional statement is one that has the form if P, then Q. Conditional statements play a vital role in logic, since logic is the discipline that attempts to determine what follows from what, and any statement to the effect that one statement follows from another is expressed by a conditional. Confirm: For P to confirm Q is for P to provide support for Q. (P: ‘Smith’s fingerprints are found in the murder-weapon used to kill Jones.’ Q: “Smith killed Jones.” P supports Q.) Confirmation is defeasible, meaning that, even if P confirms Q, some other statement might provide more support for not-Q than P provides for Q. (R: “There is a video-tape of Brown killing Smith, then pressing the hand of Smith, who is at the crime-scene but unconscious, around the murder-weapon, and then leaving it at the scene.”) Entailment is not defeasible. A consequence is that P cannot, if true, entail Q without Q’s being true. See “confirmation.” Confirmation: P confirms Q if, supposing that P is true, it’s possible that Q is false but it’s more likely than not that Q is true. “Smith is a Harvard professor” confirms “Smith is not a complete moron,” but it doesn’t entail it. See “confirm” and “entailment.” Conjunct: In P and Q, each of P and Q is a “conjunct.” So snow is white is one of the conjuncts of snow is white and grass is green.

One last example: “for all x” is a connective, and if you say “for all x, x is a mammal if x is a whale,” you are attributing a characteristic (that of being correct) to each of infinitely many propositions. (That is why, even though “for all x” and other quantifiers don’t operate on sentences, they nonetheless qualify as connectives. Connectives attribute properties to propositions. This is what quantifiers do. In fact, quantifiers do it on an even larger scale than other connectives. Consider the quantifier “for all x.” When coupled with the open sentence “x is tall,” this yields a sentence (“for all x, x is tall”) that says of an infinitely large class of propositions (viz. those having the form x is tall) that each of its members is true.

A sentence can have more than one connective. An example of such a sentence would be: (*) “either Jim is in Idaho and Larry is in Idaho with Jim, or Larry is in Delaware and Fred is with Larry in Delaware.” The main connective of (*) is “or.” Why is it the main connective?

According to this view, for the button’s being pushed to cause the elevator to come is for it to be the case that the elevator wouldn’t have come if the button hadn’t been pushed. In Chapter 17, it is shown why this view is false. Contextual definition: See “denotative vs. ostensive vs. descriptive vs. contextual definition.” Defeasible: A tendency or principle is “defeasible” if it can be overridden. Definite description: Expressions of the form ‹the phi›, where phi is in the singular, are known as “definite descriptions.” So “the inventor of Velcro,” is a definite description, as is “the inventor of bifocals.” See “quantifier.” Define/definition: To define an expression is to say what it means. Expressions are defined, not objects. “Bill Clinton” is defined, not Bill Clinton. Definition by abstraction: In some cases, it can be said what it is for two things, x and y, to share some property P without using any expression that refers to P. In such cases, it is possible to translate statements in which expressions referring to that property occur into statements in which such expressions don’t occur; and when this is done, the property in question is thereby defined in abstraction. For example, two lines have the same direction (i.e., share the property of pointing in a given direction) if they don’t intersect. Thus, the direction D of a given line L may be defined as the class of all lines L* that don’t intersect with L, and “y has direction D” may be seen as saying the same thing as “y doesn’t intersect with L.” Demonstrative: Some indexicals must be accompanied by an act of demonstration—an act of pointing, or some equivalent—if they are to succeed in picking out their target.

The meaning of “no aardvark” is given by the rule that, for any phi, ‹no aardvark has phi› is true exactly if the property of not being both an aardvark and a phi is universally instantiated. See “define/definition.” Commentary—A principle concerning contextual definition: Whenever an expression is defined contextually, as opposed to denotatively, whole sentences containing it must be reparsed if their meanings are to be made clear. We just saw this with “something.” Its meaning is given by the rule that, for any property psi: (SP) ‹something has psi› means (PS) the property of being a psi is instantiated. PS doesn’t have the same form as SP. PS is a wholesale reparsing of SP; and the reason is obviously that “someone” is defined contextually. The same is true of all expressions that are defined contextually. For any psi, ‹something has psi› attributes a property to another property, and not to an individual. (In analytic philosophy, the term “individual” refers, not only to people, but to anything that isn’t itself a property—to rocks, trees, galaxies, etc.) “Someone is tall” attributes the property of being instated to the property of tallness. Additional commentary: All denotative definitions are contextual definitions, but not vice versa. To say that, for some object x, “Smith” refers to x is to say that, for any phi, ‹Smith has phi› is to the effect that x has phi. So in defining “Smith” by identifying its referent, one is giving its meaning by saying what is meant by whole sentences of the form ‹...Smith...› This principle is defended in Chapter 7.

Quine (1908–2001)2, that no theory does either a better job or a worse job than any other theory of modeling any given body of data. In other words, given any body of observations B and given any two theories T and T*, T does no better and no worse a job than T* of modeling B. Quine’s argument was that, given any datum D that appears to confirm T and to disconfirm T*, one can make D disconfirm T and disconfirm T* by tinkering with one’s background assumptions. Quine’s thesis is either empty or it’s false. Scientific theories aren’t analytically entailed by the observations that support them. Induction isn’t deduction. This is an obvious triviality. So, assuming that what Quine is saying isn’t trivial, it must be to the effect that no theory does a better job or a worse job than any other theory of accounting for any given body of data. To account for a body of data is to show that the occurrence of each datum composing it is non-anomalous. Thus, Quine’s thesis, supposing it non-trivial, is to the effect that no theory does a better job than any other theory of removing causal anomalies from any given body of data. Thus interpreted, Quine’s thesis is clearly false.

According to Quine, by tinkering around with background assumptions, T models the observational data as well as T*. But that’s clearly false. Quine says that, in situations like this, we should “plead hallucination.” In other words, we should assume that the observations in question, most of which are had by people who do not otherwise have any history of hallucinations, are hallucinations. If we make this assumption, we’re stuck with a huge number of otherwise non-existent anomalies. We’re stuck having to explain, or to regard it as incapable of explanation, why it is that people who never had hallucinations before all of a sudden started hallucinating; and we are also stuck having to explain/regard as inexplicable why it is that people who did...",

Existential generalization (second meaning): An inference of the form “O has phi; therefore, something or other has phi,”—for example, “Bob is over 7-feet tall. Therefore, something is over 7-feet tall.” Export/exportation: To “export” an expression occurring in some sentence is to move it from the inside of that sentence to the outside. Consider the sentence “snow is not white.” That is equivalent with “it is not the case that snow is white.” In the latter sentence, the negation-sign has been pushed to the outside of the sentence. For this reason, the second sentence, unlike the first, makes it clear that the scope of the negation is (in each sentence) an entire sentence (viz. “snow is white”). Making the meanings of sentences clear almost often involves expression-exportation. Expression-types vs. expression-tokens: A given word can occur on several occasions. There have been countless utterances of the word “snow.” An utterance (or inscription) of that word is called a token of that word. The word itself is called a “word-type.” So word-tokens are bits of noise, ink, etc. Word-types are things of which these noises (etc.) are instances. “Exactly if”: See “iff.” Epistemically possible: A statement S is epistemically possible iff, given only what you know, it isn’t ruled out. So if, given only the data at your disposal, it cannot be ruled out that Smith is not in Greenland, then “Smith is not in Greenland” is an epistemic possibility. It’s obvious that epistemic possibility is a relative notion. At a given time, a given statement may be epistemically possible to some and not epistemically possible to others; and a given statement may be epistemically possible to a given person at one time but not at some other time. (If you go to Greenland, and see that Smith is there, then it’s no longer epistemically possible—for you—that Smith...",

Free variable: See “open-sentences.” Function: A rule that assigns no more than one object to each object in some specified class of objects. Thus, the rule that assigns the number two to the number one, and the number four to the number two, etc., is a function. (In other words, F(x) = 2x is a function.) But, importantly, not all functions involve numbers—a fact that Frege turned to good account. Functionalism: The doctrine that for x to be a mental state of a given kind (e.g., for it to be a belief that snow is white) is for it to have certain effects and certain causes. (More formally: given any mental category M, there are certain causes and certain effects such that, given any entity x, x falls into M iff x has those causes and those effects.) Thus, anything that has the causes and effects of (say) a belief that snow is white is itself, for that very reason, a belief that snow is white. See “materialism.” Hedonism (first meaning): The psychological doctrine that nobody can do anything other than pursue his or own pleasure. One problem with this doctrine is that not all forms of well-being are identical with the experiencing of pleasure. In fact, not all forms of enjoyment are identical with pleasure. I enjoy playing tennis. I experience pleasure when I have a few beers. My agency is implicated in the enjoyment I derive from tennis. The joy I derive from tennis is joy that I earn. By contrast, the joy I derive from alcohol is not joy that I earn. My agency isn’t involved. (My agency is involved in lifting the bottle to my mouth. But whereas that act is only a means to the actual source of pleasure—namely, the biochemical reactions that take place in my liver—the act of hitting a good backhand is itself a source of joy; it is constitutively, as opposed to merely instrumentally, involved in the joy I experience when I play tennis.) The word “pleasure” denotes enjoyment of this (non-agential) kind. The contempt that puritans have for pleasure is rooted in the fact that, whereas one’s agency and, therefore,...",

In other words, it has the property of being instantiated. The property of being a golden mountain does not have that property, since there are no instances of it. It thus has the property of being uninstantiated. Instantiatedness and un-instantiatedness are the two most important higher-order properties. The property of being a person has the property of being such that each of its instances also has the property of being a mammal. Many sentences (propositions) that appear to be about individuals are in fact about properties. Frege discovered this, and it is undoubtedly the most important insight in the history of semantics. The expressions “exist” and “doesn’t exist” refer to higher-order properties. So “even numbers exist” means: the property of being an even number is instantiated. Thus, when appropriately re-parsed, “exist” proves to mean is instantiated and “even number,” in that context, proves to mean the property of being an even number. And “even prime numbers greater than two don’t exist” means: the property of being an even number greater than two is un-instantiated. Thus, when that sentence is duly re-parsed, “don’t exist” means is un-instantiated, and (in that context) “even prime numbers greater than two” means: the property of being an even number greater than two. “Iff,” “just in case,” “exactly if,” “↔’: “Iff ” abbreviates “if and only if.” “P iff Q” means that P and Q are equivalent. “just in case” and “exactly if” are synonyms of “iff.” So “P just in case Q” means the same thing as “P iff Q,” and each means the same thing as “P exactly if Q”; and each of those means the same thing as “P→Q.” Incompatibilism: The doctrine that there cannot be personal freedom in a deterministic world. “Compatibilism” is the doctrine that incompatibilism is false.

See “numerical identity.” Individual: In analytic philosophy, the word “individual” has two meanings. First meaning: An individual is anything about which statements are being made. Rocks, trees, and lizards are individuals in a given context, provided that, in that context, statements are being made about them. If, in that context, no statements are being made about the property of being green, then, in that context, that property doesn’t qualify as an “individual.” But in other contexts it might so qualify. Second meaning: Individuals are discrete, spatiotemporal entities—they are “things,” in the narrowest sense of the word. For reasons that are given in Chapter 16, this means that an individual is any causal series. See “causal series.” Informal analytic truth: A statement is analytically true if it’s non-empirically true (i.e., if its negation is prohibited from being true by the structures of concepts and by logical laws). An analytic truth is informal if other statements of the same form are false. Thus, any case of knowledge is a case of belief is an analytic truth, since its negation is incoherent, and it’s not formally true since it has the same form as any case of knowledge is a case of happiness, which is false. See “analytic” and “entailment.” Instance of an open-sentence: Given some open-sentence O, if some actual sentence S is what results when the free variables in O are replaced with constants, S is an instance of O. So “Smith is tall” is an instance of ‹x is tall›, and “Smith is tall” is also an instance of ‹Smith has property phi.› See “open-sentence” and “quasi-quotation.” Instance of a property: If something has a property, then it is an instance of that property. We are all instances of the property of being human. Instances of properties are not identical with those properties themselves. I am not identical with the property of being human since my fellow humans are not instances of me.

As it used in philosophy, the word “interpretation” sometimes bears this meaning; but it sometimes bears a very different one. An “interpretation,” in the distinctly philosophical sense of the word, is an assignment of meaning to an expression that contains undefined or only partially defined constituents. (In what follows, the words “interpretation” and “interpret” (etc.) will be used only in the second, strictly philosophical sense.) It is statement-forms, not statements proper, that are interpreted. (A statement-form is an open-sentence.) The reason is that anything with an undefined constituent ipso facto fails to say anything true or false. To interpret an open-sentence is to assign constants to the variables. So one way to interpret “x is even and y is odd” would be to assign the numbers two and three to “x” and “y,” respectively. That interpretation of that statement-form validates it, meaning that the resulting sentence is correct. By assigning three and two to “x” and “y” respectively, we’ve produced an interpretation of it that fails to validate it. And by assigning Barack Obama to “x’” and the property of being the U.S. President in 2009 to “phi,” I’ve produced an interpretation of “x is phi” that validates it. Oftentimes, expressions that seem not to contain free variables do. For example, “Jim is a nice guy” is so vague, that until a specific meaning has been assigned to “nice,” nothing has really been said. Where expressions of this sort are concerned, context tends to supply the missing interpretations, that being why we don’t see “nice” as being a variable, like “phi.” Also, with “nice,” there is an understood, and quite restricted, range of possible interpretations, whereas with “phi,” that range is likely to be more open-ended. Thus, we’re quick to see “phi” for the variable that it is, but not so quick to do so with “nice.” “Just in case”: See “iff.” Leibniz’s Law: “According to Leibniz’s Law, if x and y are numerically identical, then the one has any property had by the other.

Meanings vs. entailment relations: For two sentences to have the same meanings, it is necessary that they be equivalent (i.e., that they be such that the one is true if and only if the other is true). So if P entails something that Q does not entail, then P and Q don’t have the same meaning. For example: “Jim is an avid reader” entails that Jim can read, whereas “Jim is a lousy soccer player” does not entail that. Therefore, those two sentences have different meanings. But even though, in order for two sentences to be equivalent, it is necessary that the one entail any sentence entailed by the other, that isn’t sufficient for sameness of meaning. For any x, ‹x is a unique even prime› is equivalent with ‹x is the unique number n such that n = 2 if there is no completeness proof for arithmetic and n = 3 otherwise.› Neither sentence entails anything not also entailed by the other. But those sentences obviously differ in meaning. For two sentences to have the same meaning, it is necessary, not only that they entail the same things, but that they do so in the same way. Even though, for any x, ‹x is a unique even prime› entails the same things as ‹x is the unique number n such that n = 2 if there is no completeness proof for arithmetic and n = 3 otherwise›, they entail those same things in different ways. For example, the way that ‹x is even› is derived from the first is very simple, whereas the way it is derived from the second is very complex.

(4) If x bears R to y, y doesn’t bear R to x. Whether (1)–(3) come out true depends on what we take “N” and “R” to stand for, and also on what we take “anything” and “nothing” to mean. Do we mean anything at all? Or do we mean anything falling into some specific class of objects (e.g., the class of numbers or of aquatic mammals)? The same question mutatis mutandis arises in connection with “nothing.” (If we take “anything” to mean “any whole number,” then the universe of discourse is the class of whole numbers. If we take it to mean “any penguin,” then the universe of discourse is the class of penguins.) To answer these questions is to provide an “interpretation” of these expressions. An “interpretation” of a set of open-sentences is thus an assignment of definite meanings to the undefined or partially defined expressions occurring in it. If, given a particular interpretation X (1)–(3) come out true, X is a “model” of (1)–(3). If, given X, (1)–(3) comes out false, then X doesn’t model them. Here’s one interpretation of (1)–(3). Take the universe of discourse to be the whole numbers (zero, one two, etc.). N is zero, and R is the relation of being the immediate predecessor of.

Killing is wrong is a normative proposition, since it says that killing shouldn’t occur. See “proposition” and “descriptive proposition.” Numerically identical: x and y are numerically identical if they are the very same thing. So Benjamin Franklin is numerically identical with the person who invented bifocals. If you punch Ben Franklin, you are also punching the inventor of bifocals and vice versa. Observable characteristic: Any characteristic of a thing that one can see or otherwise sense-perceive. One can see that a thing is red. One can feel that a thing is solid. Thus, redness and solidity are, in at least some instances, observable characteristics. One cannot see that a thing consists of such and such micro-particles. Thus, the property of being composed of such things is not an observable one. It’s obvious that whether a given characteristic is observable or not is typically context-dependent. A thing’s being red or solid might be as theoretical a fact as its consisting of molecules of a certain kind. To creatures of our intelligence level, but of one-trillionth our size, the fact that my desk is solid could be known only through elaborate inferences; and its being solid would not, in that context, be something that could be observed. Still, the distinction between observable and unobservable characteristics is a good one. But, when saying that x’s having phi is (un)observable, one must realize that what one is saying is elliptical for a relational statement of the form: given the nature of physical relationship to x, x’s having phi is, with respect to us, an (un)observable fact.

It studies relations holding among the sentence-schemata. “Grass is green and show is white” entails “snow is white.” The logician is interested in this fact only to the extent that it alerts him to the corresponding generalization, viz. for any sentences P and Q, ‹P and Q› entails ‹P. › But ‹P and Q› and ‹P› are not sentences; they’re open-sentences; they’re sentence-like entities that contain free variables and, unlike real sentences, are therefore neither true nor false. Operator: An “operator” is any expression that, when joined with a sentence, forms a new sentence. So “it is possible” is an operator, since, when conjoined with “Smith is in France,” a new sentence is formed, namely “it is possible that Smith is in France.” And “George believes” is also an operator for the same reason. There are many kinds of operators; but two kinds are of special importance: modal operators and epistemic operators. See “predicates” and “quasi-quotation marks.” “Other things being equal”: See “ceteris paribus.” Perception: See “sense-perception.” Performative utterance: When, in the context of a marriage ceremony, the priest says “I now pronounce you man and wife,” the priest is not (so it would seem, and so we’ll momentarily assume) reporting an existing fact.

He is not affirming the already existing truth that he is now in the process of forging a marital bond between the two individuals before him. In uttering those words, he is creating a fact, not reporting a fact. A sentence-utterance functioning in this way is known as a “performative” utterance. Other examples of Performatives are utterances of “I christen this ship the Mel Gibson,” “I hereby challenge you to a duel,” and “I promise to pay you back with interest if you loan me the money.” The concept of a performative was first clearly identified by J.L. Austin in his (1955) lectures at Harvard, which were published in 1976 under the title How to do things with Words. Austin’s points are anticipated, albeit obscurely, by Wittgenstein (1958). Austin said, very plausibly, that performative utterances are neither true nor false.

In saying this, Wittgenstein was trying to undermine the view that sentences report facts; he was trying to vindicate his provocative—but, when scrutinized, quite hollow—contention that “words are deeds.” (This contention is one to which Austin gave some substance in his theory of performative utterances.) We can use an analogue of Soames’ argument to refute this contention of Wittgenstein’s. If, as Wittgenstein alleges, a stand-alone occurrence of “I am sad” is neither true nor false, as it’s merely a glorified frown, then it’s counterpart in an utterance of (S#) “if it’s supposed true that I am sad, then I am in a mood that is, in at least some respects, less than optimal” is equally meaningless, an immediate corollary being that any utterance of S# is meaningless. But such an utterance is quite meaningful; in fact, such utterances are correct. Also, if you say “I am sad,” you are obviously reporting a fact. That’s why your utterance could be false—you could be lying after all. Thus, utterances of “I am sad,” and first-person reports generally, can be meaningful, and usually are, contrary to what Wittgenstein is alleging. Personal stratum of cognition: The totality of mental events within one’s own mind that could in principle fall within the scope of introspective awareness.

So far as you can become aware of them, it is in the way that you can be aware of sub-atomic particles, and not in the direct, introspective way in which you are aware of your own sensations. No amount of psychoanalytic intervention could make you introspectively aware of them, and they are therefore “deeply” unconscious, to use Chomsky’s term. But, given psychoanalytic intervention, you could become introspectively aware of the unconscious events and conditions posited by Freud. Thus, the Freudian unconscious falls within the scope of the personal stratum of cognition, as does everything that, without such intervention, is accessible to introspection. The cognitive processes mediating language-comprehension, perception, etc., are not done by you, even though they happen in your mind.

But this isn’t a good definition. The expression “the property of being tall” is not a predicate; it’s actually a singular term. But “tall” is a predicate. So is “smart.” In general, a predicate is an expression that, when joined in a grammatically acceptable manner with a singular term, yields a sentence that attributes a property to the individual referred to by that term. “Smart” is a predicate because, when joined (in a grammatically acceptable way) with “Sally,” the result is a sentence that attributes smartness to Sally, viz. “Sally is smart.” Predicates may be identified with open-sentences. See “intensions vs. extensions” and “open-sentences.” Primitive expression: Synonymous with “semantically simple expression.” A primitive expression is one that doesn’t consist of other expressions. Examples of such expressions are “red” or “sweet.” Occurrences of primitive expressions are not as easy to identify as one might think. Let T be an utterance of “snow is white.” One would think that, in T, the occurrence of “snow” is semantically simple. Chomsky would say that it contains a phonetically unrealized case-marker. Chomsky’s reasons for taking this view are extremely compelling. See Chomsky (1965, 1998). Probability: This word is “ambiguous.” It has (at least) two meanings. First, there is the statistical meaning of “probability.” If there are 10 balls in the urn, only one of which is white, the statement “x is a white ball in the urn” has a statistical probability of 1/10. Then there is explanatory probability. P makes Q probable in the explanatory sense if, given what it is that is already believed, there are more causal anomalies if P is true and Q is false than there are if, other things being equal, P is true and Q is true. It is argued in Chapter 11 that explanatory probability cannot be reduced to, or understood in terms of, statistical probability. Property: A property is a characteristic.

More generally, grasping a proposition is something mental; but the thing grasped is not. Let’s suppose that: (1) “Smith believes that the inventor of bifocals is 6-feet tall’ is true. What is the object of Smith’s belief? What is the thing believed in—the thing that, in having that belief, he believes to be true? It’s tempting to say that it’s something mental—that it’s some mental event or psychological condition. But this is wrong. Smith’s having that belief is indeed a psychological condition. But the thing believed is not. The believing is mental; the believed is not.

    "text": "Additional commentary: Propositions have the distinctive and crucially important property of being non-derivatively true or false. What does this mean? Propositions are obviously true or false. (It’s true that Finland is in Europe; it’s false that it’s an island in the Pacific Ocean.) To be sure, things other than propositions are true or false (e.g., sentences and beliefs). The sentence “Finland is in Europe” is true. But that sentence is true only by virtue of its association with the corresponding proposition. That sentence is true only because it expresses a true proposition. So it’s really the proposition that deserves to be described, without qualification, as “true”; and when we say of the sentence that it’s “true,” we’re using the word “true” to pick out a related, but distinct, property; we’re using it to pick out the property of encoding something that’s true. And these, it must be stressed, are very different properties. It’s one thing to have the property of being true. (The proposition Finland is in Europe has that property. It’s quite another to have the property of encoding something true.) The sentence “Finland is in Europe” has that property. But the corresponding proposition does not have it, since propositions, unlike sentences, don’t encode anything. What we just said about sentences is true of beliefs. My belief that Finland’s in Europe is “true.” But it’s true only because of its association with a true proposition. In other words, it’s “true” in the sense that it has for its content something that is true. Put another way, the thing which that belief is a belief in is true, and the belief is “true” only in the second-class sense that it has this association with this other thing—this other being something that, unlike the sentence, is true in a first-class, non-derivative sense. Propositions are thus “non-derivatively true,” whereas beliefs and sentences are “derivatively true.” For this reason, propositions are sometimes defined as “non-derivative bearers of truth and falsity.” We thus have three different definitions of “proposition”: (i) thing meant by a sentence; (ii) thing towards which one can have an attitude (e.g., belief, disbelief, fear, hope); (iii) non-derivative bearer of truth or falsity. While no one of these definitions is 100% accurate each is accurate to a high degree of approximation; and while no two of them are precisely equivalent (i.e., while no two of them pick out precisely the same...",

So Larry falls ill. Jerry eats a fish; he isn’t allergic to fish, but the fish he eats is rotten. So he falls ill. What made Larry sick wasn’t his eating a fish; it was his eating something that had X in it. That thing happened to be a fish, but that wasn’t what was operative. Thus, it wasn’t in virtue of his eating a fish, but in virtue of his eating something containing X, that Larry became sick. Put another way, it was his eating a fish qua thing that contained X, not a fish qua fish, that made Larry sick. Similarly, it was Jerry’s eating a fish qua rotten thing, not a fish qua fish, that made him sick. Qualitatively identical: x and y are qualitatively identical if they resemble each other to a maximally high degree but may nonetheless be distinct individuals. So if you have an identical twin—a twin who looks, thinks, talks, acts (and so on) just like you—then you are qualitatively identical with that person. But you are not numerically identical with that person, since you are not literally the very same individual as that other person. Quantified generalization: Any sentence or proposition that says of some property how many instances it has. Thus, nothing snores is a quantified generalization since it says of the property of being a snorer that it has no instances.

See “quantifier.” Quantifier: An expression that, when coupled with a predicate yields a sentence saying how many things of a given kind have that property. A predicate may roughly be said to be an expression denoting a property (e.g., “snore,” “is tall”). (Why only roughly? See below.) “All people” is a quantifier, since, when coupled with “snore,” which denotes the property of snoring, yields “all people snore,” which says how many things of a certain kind have the property of snoring. “No fish” is a quantifier since, given the expression snore, yields the...",

But snow doesn’t have four letters. So the sentence “snow has four letters” is false. Snow is white, crystalline substance, which consists, not of letter, but of H2O molecules. In the philosophy of language, we often wish to refer to expressions themselves—we often wish to talk, not about snow (the substance), but “snow” (the word that substance).We do this by putting quotation marks around the expression to which we refer. So “snow” refers to the word that refers to the substance.

Rationalists typically hold that knowledge is a prerequisite for our acquiring sensory information and also for our making any inferences from it. Since such knowledge couldn’t possibly be observation based, it must have some other basis, this other basis being “pure reason.” Rationalists hold that knowledge of logical norms is non-perceptual, their argument being that sense-perception apprises us of what is, not of what ought to be (even in a narrowly logical sense).

One way of doing so is to assume the negation of P and then show that has a self-contradictory result. Your position is that there are no even primes greater than two. The negation of your position is that there are even primes greater than two. You apprise your friend of your viewpoint. He disagrees. You respond by saying: “Let’s suppose you’re right.

Given some object O, a given act A that is performed by so and so is a case of so and so’s referring to O if, in performing A, it was so and so’s intention to make a statement about O. Let’s refer to this sort of reference as “reference*.” In the sentence, “the name ‘Socrates’ refers to a certain philosopher,” the occurrence of the word “refers” picks out a property of expressions, not of actions. To say that an expression E refers to some object O is to say that, in virtue of containing E, a sentence ipso facto concerns O. “Socrates” refers to Socrates because, in virtue of having the form “...Socrates...,” a sentence says that Socrates has...x...(“Socrates is tall” says that Socrates has the property of being a thing x such that x is tall. “Plato admires Socrates” says that Socrates has the property of being a thing x such that Plato admires x.) Let us refer to this sort of reference as “reference#.” Some authors5 have tried to show that reference# was identical with reference* or, at the very least, capable of being understood in terms of it. This is radically absurd.6 Reference* presupposes reference#. Nobody could refer* to anything unless there were already meaningful expressions and, therefore, referring# terms. In Chapter 4, Sections 5.3.2–5.3.4, it is explained why this is so. (So far as I know, it was John Searle, in his classic (1966) work Speech Acts, who made this important point for the first time in print.)

Commentary: Those who hold that definite descriptions are quantifiers, as opposed to referring terms, will reject what was just said. See Chapter 6. See “definite descriptions” and “quantifier.” Sense-perception: Sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell, and one’s bodily kinesthetic sense (the feeling of resistance one experiences when trying to move objects—this sensory modality involves touch but isn’t identical with it). The two distinguishing features of sense-perception are (i) that it yields knowledge that is (at the personal level of cognition) non-inferential, and (ii) perceptual information varies in real-time with the states of affairs it concerns. See “personal stratum of cognition.” Sets and classes: A class is simply a collection of some kind—for example, the class of numbers, the class of even numbers, the class of people, the class of people who are taking philosophy 101 this semester, the class of smart people, the class of talented athletes. The word “set” is sometimes used instead of “class.” We’ll use these terms interchangeably. (Some set-theorists, e.g., Quine (1956), do not do so.) Commentary: The sets that are of intellectual interest are usually ones whose members have some property in common with one another that nothing else has in common with any of them. So, for example, we talk about the set of whole numbers, the set of people who have survived pancreatic cancer, the set of people who are currently philosophy professors. Let S1, S2, and S3 be these three sets. Every member of S1 has the property of being a whole number and nothing that isn’t a member of S1 has that property. Thus, the property of being a whole number generates S1. The property of being a survivor of pancreatic cancer and the property of being a philosophy professor generate S2 and S3, respectively. Technically, given any set, there is some property that all and only its members have in common. But oftentimes these properties are very contrived. Let S be the set consisting of Smith and the number two. Everything in S has the property of being identical either with Smith or with the number, and nothing outside of that set has that property.

Therefore, (3) and (4) must co-refer, supposing that either refers to anything. Therefore, (1) and (4) must co-refer, supposing that they refer to anything. If the occurrences in (1)–(4) “Mozart was a composer” and “Bill Clinton was U.S. President in 1997” are replaced with occurrences of any two true sentences, the argument that results is cogent. Thus, any two true sentences co-refer, supposing that any true sentence refers to anything.

In which case, (3) is not what result when a referring term is replaced with a co-referring term. (It’s what results when a non-referring term is replaced with a non-referring term.) So SS is a failure. Also, it’s obvious that “snow is white” doesn’t co-refer with “the property of being true” (or with “the True”). In virtue of having the form, “...the property of being true...” a sentence is about the property of being true. (“Everything Bill says has the property of being true” says of the property of being true that it is instantiated by everything that Bill says.) But in virtue of having the form “...snow is white...” a sentence is about the proposition that snow is white. (“If snow is white, then snow isn’t green” says that the proposition that snow is white, if true, has the proposition that snow isn’t green as a consequence. Of course, “if snow is white, then snow isn’t green” can, like any other sentence, be interpreted as concerning the property of being true—it can be interpreted as saying that the property of being true is a characteristic of the proposition that snow isn’t green if it’s white. But it isn’t in virtue of it’s containing an occurrence of “snow is white” that “if snow is white, then snow isn’t green” concerns that property.) So unless the concept of reference is warped beyond all recognition—unless the term “reference” is redefined to as to validate this argument—what SS establishes, supposing its premises true, is false. In any case, we’ve seen independently of this that not all of it’s premises are true. But Donald Davidson took it for granted that SS is cogent.10 And he argued that, given the (alleged) fact that SS is cogent, it follows that there is only one fact. His argument is simple.

Giving one dollar to a poor person won’t make him stop being poor. So, no matter how many times you give a dollar to a poor person, he won’t stop being poor. Therefore, a person who has been given $500,000,000 dollars is poor. A sorites paradox always consists of a base-clause (e.g., “a person with zero dollars is poor”), an inductive clause (e.g., “if a person with n dollars is poor, so is a person with n + 1 dollars), and an obviously false conclusion that seems to follow (e.g., “a person with a billion dollars is poor”).” Commentary: My solution to this paradox: Statements of the form “x is rich” are elliptical for statements of the form “x is rich compared to y,” where y is either some person or some benchmark. When the benchmark is identified, the underlined sentence is seen to be false.

According to special compositionality, what a referring term refers to is a function of what its parts refer to. “The author of War and Peace” refers to one person. “The author of Crime and Punishment” refers to someone else. Why do those expressions refer to different people? Because War and Peace doesn’t refer to the same book as Crime and Punishment.

See “synthetic truth.” Synthetic truth: A statement is synthetic if it isn’t analytic. See “analytic” and “synthetic knowledge.” Tautology/truism: A tautology (or truism) is a trivially true statement—for example, “there are three feet in a yard” or “Tuesdays come after Mondays” or “there are two weeks in a fortnight.” Theory of Descriptions: The position, first advocated in 1905 by Bertrand Russell, that definite descriptions are not devices of reference and are instead quantifiers. “The inventor of bifocals” seems to refer to Benjamin Franklin. But “the inventor of bifocals snored” is true iff exactly one thing invented bifocals, and any such snored. “Smith kicked the inventor of bifocals is true iff exactly one thing invented bifocals, and Smith kicked any such thing. What this shows is that, in virtue of containing an occurrence of “the inventor of bifocals,” an expression encodes an existence-claim. This, in its turn, suggests that “the inventor of bifocals,” and by parity of reasoning all other definite descriptions, are quantifiers, not singular terms. Truth: A true proposition is said to be one that “corresponds to the facts.” But this statement is useless, since the expression “corresponds to the facts” is as obscure as the expression “true.” Given any proposition, there is some condition that is fulfilled if, and only if, that proposition is true. Conditions may be identified with properties. Therefore, truth may be identified with instantiatedness, and propositions (i.e., the things that have the property of being true) are properties (or, strictly speaking, sets there). See Chapter 3. Many philosophers (e.g., Ayer, Hempel, Strawson, Wittgenstein) were, at least at certain junctures in their careers, of the view that “truth” (and “true” and other such terms) were meaningless. There is, it was said, no difference between saying “the sentence ‘snow is white’ is true” and “snow is white”; therefore, the words “it is true that” (and “it...",

To say (SD) “some dolphins can read” is to say that (SD) for some object x, the proposition x can read is true. Truth-value: A true sentence has the truth-value true, and a false sentence has the truth-value false. The truth-values true and false can be thought of as, respectively, the property of being true and the property of being false. If two sentences are both true or they are both false, they have the same “truth-value.” So “1 + 1 = 2” and “2 + 2 = 4” have the same truth-value—they have truth-value true. And so “1 + 1 = 3” and “2 + 2 = 5” have the same truth-value—the truth-value false. Universal generalization: A sentence expresses a “universal generalization” if the main connective of that sentence is a universal quantifier.14 A connective is an expression that, when given a sentence, or open sentence, or ordered n-tuple of (open) sentences, yields a new sentence. Thus “and” is a connective because, when given the pair of sentences (“grass is green,” “snow is white”), it yields the sentence “grass is green and snow is white.” (In what follows, “sentence” will be short for “sentence or open sentence of ordered n-tuple of sentences or open-sentences.”) Commentary: Many statements that seem to be conditionals are not, and are instead universal generalizations. For example if a thing likes apples, it is friendly, is a universal generalization, not a conditional. The reason: it’s identical with the proposition: all things are such that they are friendly if they like apples. Put another way, it’s identical with: for any x, if x likes apples, x is friendly. Thus, the “main connective” of the sentence “if a thing likes apples, it is friendly” isn’t “if,” and is instead “for any object x”; and for this reason, it’s a universal generalization, not a conditional.
