Proof that we have always known the theory of evolution to be true These days it is pretty much agreed that human beings evolved from other, “lower” life forms and that, ultimately, we come from the same stock as monkeys, reptiles, and insects. This discovery was, of course, a massive blow to our self-esteem. Given that our forbears are single-celled organisms, it becomes hard to see how, in any cosmic sense, we could be special. We are, it would seem, just very sophisticated protozoa. Once it is agreed that we came into existence by a process of evolution, it becomes hard to maintain that we were created by an almighty God. (Of course, it could be said that he created us by creating organisms from which we evolved. But somehow that position isn’t very satisfying.) Further, the creatures from which we evolved -- reptiles, amphibians, single-celled organisms...",

    "text": "* One might make the following claim on Kant’s behalf: How could we learn the truths of geometry, if not through visual intuitions? In any case, whether or not we could learn them in some other way, we do learn at least some of them through intuition. This would seem to support Kant’s view. When you learn through mental imagery that a straight line intersects a circle at no more than two points, you are learning something that is made true by the concepts CIRCLE and LINE, and so forth. You are not learning something that is made true by our cognitive machinery. Nothing about circles could be made true by our cognitive machinery. When we do learn facts about geometry or perhaps arithmetic through an exercise of powers of imaging, what is really going is conceptual analysis, the vehicle for which, in those cases, happens to be mental imagery. There is no reason why images should not mediate conceptual analysis. So given only that some truth is discovered through thought involving mental imagery, it doesn’t follow that it is synthetic. What led Kant astray was a failure to distinguish the different roles that mental imagery can play in the acquisition of knowledge. Kant noted that mental imagery is a kind of para-perception. He concluded from this that, when mental imagery is involved in the discovery of some truth, that truth is synthetic – like those truths that we use perception to discover. The idea is that, if the truth in question were purely conceptual, then we wouldn’t need to use para-perception to ascertain it. But that is simply false. If somebody asks me “what is the minimum number of sides a solid can have?”, I base my answer on a mental image that [15] I produce. I imagine trying to produce a solid out of four sides, then note that it doesn’t work, then try to do the same thing with five sides, and note that it does work. But surely the fact that a solid has to have a minimum of five sides is not synthetic. That proposition holds entirely in virtue of mathematics – in virtue of the structure of the concepts five and solid and so forth. It is true that I rely to some extent on imagery to learn this truth. But the imagery is a vehicle for conceptual analysis. It might seem that Kant...",

    "text": "* There is an incoherence in Kant’s thinking even more radical than anymentioned so far. He rightly wants to hold that propositions like 7+2=9 and the area of a (Euclidean) triangle is ½ the base×height are a priori. But he also says that we sense-perceive the world as being such that these propositions are true in it. Of course, if the world can be seen (literally seen) as being such that 7+2=9 is true in it, then 7+9=12 is descriptive of the spatiotemporal world. If 7+2=9 said absolutely nothing about the spatiotemporal world, then the truth or falsity of that proposition couldn’t make any difference to how the spatiotemporal world seemed to us. So, on Kant’s view, these propositions say something about the spatiotemporal world. But 7+2=9 doesn’t say anything about the spatio-temporal world; it doesn’t say that if you hold up two fingers and then hold up seven fingers, nine fingers are on display. For there could, in principle, be a causal law that falsified just that sort of statement – a law that didn’t allow more than five fingers to be simultaneously on display in a certain region. The same is true of Kant’s claim that we must sense-perceive the world as being such that, in it, straight lines are the shortest distances between pairs of points. The proposition a straight line is the shortest distance between two points says nothing at all about the spatio-temporal world; it defines a certain kind of space. Of course, there are empirical propositions – concerning light rays and point-masses – that are analogous to that purely mathematical proposition. But surely Kant doesn’t have these in mind when he says it is a priori that a straight line is the shortest distance between two points. So Kant’s position is self-undermining. He needs mathematical propositions to be two things at once. They must be descriptive of the world: they must say something about beams of light. But they must also not be descriptive of the world: they must not be capable of falsification by anything having to do with beams of light and the like. A Kantian might reply by saying: Propositions like 7+2=9 and a straight line is the shortest distance between two points do describe the empirical world. They describe necessary features of it. So 7+2=9 is like grass is green in one respect: it is descriptive of the empirical world....",

    "text": "* a circle is not a class of points equidistant from a given point in a plane. His reasoning seems to be this: A proposition is analytic exactly if one is guilty of incoherence in virtue of countenancing its negation. One is guilty of incoherence if one thinks that (*) is false. But is not guilty of incoherence if one thinks that (**) is false. One is wrong to think that (**) is false, but not incoherent. To be incoherent is to think in a way that is counter-conceptual. Thus (*) is counter-conceptual. (**) is not counter-conceptual. An analytic proposition is one that is made true by concepts. An analytically false proposition is one that is made false by concepts: a counterconceptual proposition. One can countenance the negation of (**) without being guilty of incoherence, and without countenancing a counter-conceptual proposition. Thus (**) is not analytic. But (**) is a priori. So we must suppose that it is made true by facts about our conceptual machinery; it embodies a fact about our conceptual schema. That is why no empirical discovery could confute it. The word “coherent” has two entirely different meanings: a psychological meaning and a purely logical meaning. If you believe (d), you are guilty of logical incoherence: the proposition you believe entails a contradiction. But a perfectly sane person could believe the negation of (d). In virtue of believing it, one is perhaps guilty of stupidity, and of incoherence in the logical sense, but not of incoherence in the psychological sense. By contrast, if you believe (c), you are guilty not just of logical, but of psychological, incoherence. You couldn’t possibly think that circles are not round; to think of something as a circle just is to think of it as round. So to think of something as a non-round circle – if such a thought is even possible - would involve a kind of double-think, a fragmentation of the psyche. The following story might be helpful.

One is guilty of logical, but not of psychological incoherence, in virtue of believing (b) and (e). Let us set say that (b) and (e) are “hard analytic”, and let us say that (a) and (h) are “easy analytic”. It is hard to know that (b) and (e) are true. It is not hard to know (a) and (h) are analytic; a grasp of those propositions by itself suffices for a knowledge of their truth. (Kant describes such propositions as “apodictic.”) What Kant refers to as “synthetic a priori” truths are nothing other than what we are describing as hard analytic truths. What Kant refers to as analytic truths are what we are describing as easy analytic truths. Once it is recognized that (b) and (e) are analytic, albeit hard analytic, we must say that they hold entirely in virtue of facts about the concepts that compose them; and there is no longer any temptation to say that they are made true by facts about the mind. So that obliterates any possible warrant that might otherwise be had by Kant’s psychologistic analysis of those propositions. § But we must remember what Kant’s larger concern is. Kant’s main concern is not a taxonomy of propositions. That is incidental to what he is doing. We have experience; we have sequences of thoughts and perceptions that cohere. The world is intelligible to us. We sense-perceive it; we think about it; and, up to a point, our perceptions and thoughts are accurate. In Kant’s view, given the very fact that these things are true, we can deduce certain things about the structure of the world. Given only that we have coherent ideation, the world must satisfy certain minimal conditions. Kant refers to those conditions as “transcendental”: they are the conditions that are necessarily satisfied by any world in which there are entities that have coherent (if not always accurate) thoughts and representations. The “necessity” just mentioned is not causal: it is of a deeper kind. A “transcendental argument” is one having the form: given only that we have experiences of such and such a kind, it follows that the world must have thus and such features.

    "text": "* Hume, David. Inquiry into the Principles of Morals. Oxford University Press, 1998 Why conceivability sometimes entails possibility: a Neo-Cartesian argument for dualism Abstract: Kripke and Putnam showed that what can coherently be conceived of is not always a guide to what is possible. But in some cases conceivability is a guide to possibility: whether it is or not depends on the structure of the proposition being considered. I make it clear under what conditions possibility and conceivability coincide, and I then show that that, where the propositions relevant to the mind-body problem are concerned, they do coincide. Thus, given that mind-body dualism is conceivable, it follows that it is actual – even though, as Kripke and Putnam were right to say, conceivability is not generally a guide to possibility. Of course, if dualism is correct, then the validity of physicalistically oriented research programs in psychology would have to be reevaluated. Introduction It used to be thought that the possibility, if not the actuality, of some kind of mind-body dualism could be established through a conceivability [56] argument. Kripke and Putnam showed that conceivability is not nearly as reliable a guide to possibility as used to be thought: I can coherently conceive of x as being water and also as not being H2O: but if x is water, then it is necessarily H2O. So what can coherently be conceived of is not necessarily possible. Thus, even though I can coherently conceive of mind as not consisting of (say) patterns of neuro-chemical activity, it doesn’t follow that mind could be anything other than such activity – let alone that it is something other than such activity. Understandably, this line of thinking has convinced many that dualism cannot be established by means of conceivability arguments. In this paper I will try to show that – even though Kripke and Putnam were basically right in what they said about conceivability as a guide to possibility – it is still possible to construct a viable conceivability argument for dualism. The classical conceivability argument [57] The old argument for dualism was basically this. What is not contrary to the laws of logic is possible. Triangles can be green because x is a triangle is logically consistent with x is green. Now x is a pain or a belief that 2+2=4 does not logically entail x is a brain event. So it is logically possible that...",

(I wish the word “state” to be taken as broadly as possible – to apply to both enduring brain-structures and occurrent phenomena.) My belief that 1+1=2 is realized by certain brain-states. My belief that water is wet is realized by a different set of brainstates. Let x be an arbitrary brain-state of mine. According to functionalism, for x to realize mental content C is for x to have a certain causal role. For x to have a certain causal role is, at least in part, for x to have such and such effects. So x realizes a belief that bread nourishes at least partly in virtue of the fact that x has certain effects – for example, it leads to my choosing to eat bread (in certain contexts). There is an obvious prima facie problem with functionalism. Mental content is causally efficacious. In any case, this is what we are inclined to think. My believing that bread nourishes is causally effective: it leads me to drive to the store, buy bread, eat said bread, and so on. Given this, suppose that brain-state x has effects E1…En. x’s having C presumably has a causal hand in bringing about at least some of E1…En. As we just saw, supposing that x is a brain-state realizing my belief that bread nourishes, x’s being such a belief is what causes me to buy bread, eat it, and so forth. But if x’s having those effects is what x’s realizing that content consists in, then x’s realizing that content cannot possibly be what causes E1…En to come about. If x’s realizing a belief that bread nourishes consists in x’s causing me to drive to the store and buy bread, eat said bread, and so on, then x’s realizing that belief cannot possibly be what causes me to drive to the story, to eat the just purchased bread, and so on. So if functionalism is right, my belief that bread nourishes ends up not having a causal hand in my going the store to buy bread; and, by an exactly similar argument, it ends up not having a causal hand in my wanting to eat bread, bake bread, and so on. It ends up not having a causal hand in any of the contexts where, quite obviously, it does have a causal hand....",

But I don’t think that insight helps out functionalism or externalism in the way that they think. First we will deal with the functionalist case. Let us start with some platitudes. Nothing can be “causally relevant” to itself. A state of affairs cannot be “causally relevant” to its own existence. Obviously things are relevant to themselves. But the relevance isn’t causal. Of course, the term “causal relevance” (as Jackson and Pettit are using it) is an invented one; so we can give it any meaning we wish. But surely it would be deeply misleading to say describe the kind of relevance that event E has to itself as causal. The relation is better described as logical, or perhaps metaphysical. E is not causally related to itself; and it doesn’t matter whether we are taking about causal efficacy or causal relevance. Obviously the kind of relation Jackson and Pettit have in mind, when they talk about “causal relevance” is some kind of causal relation; it is not a relation which something can have to itself; the word “causal” is there for a reason. So nothing can be “causally relevant” to itself. The functionalist says that x’s causing E1…En is what x’s having C consists in. There is an identity here, not a causal relation. At the same time, it is clear, from a common-sense point of view, that x’s having content C – e.g. x’s being a desire for water – has some kind of causal hand in bringing about E1…En (i.e. that it has a causal hand in bringing it about that Smith reaches for the glass). If x’s having C is identical with x’s bringing about E1…En, x’s having C cannot be causally effective in bringing about E1…En: after all, x’s bringing about E1…En cannot cause x’s bringing about E1…En. By the same token, x’s having C cannot be causally relevant to the bringing about of E1…En. Nothing can be causally relevant to itself. If the functionalist is right, then x’s bringing about E1…En is identical with x’s having C. So if the functionalist is right, then x’s having C – i.e. its bringing about E1…En – cannot be causally relevant to its bringing about E1…En.

    "text": "* To deal with the externalist-case, a background point is in order.Sometimes Jackson and Pettit analyze the notion of causal relevance in counter-factual terms: x is causally relevant to the occurrence of y if, in any counterfactual circumstance where x exists, there also exists something causally effective in bringing about y. The problem is that this is too generous. My striking the glass with the hammer is sufficient, in the counterfactual sense just defined, for the breaking of the glass. The same is true my of striking the glass while wearing a yellow hat and having green teeth and wearing a spacesuit…But surely my wearing a yellow hat/spacesuit/having green teeth…is not in any sense “causally relevant” to the breaking of the glass. The counterfactual analysis is too broad, too expansive. The counter-factual analysis of causal relevance needs to be tightened. But we don’t want to tighten it too much. For example, we don’t want to say that the program-cause is the smallest thing x such that x counterfactually guarantees the presence of something causally efficacious. After all, the smallest thing that gives that guarantee is the mass-energy displacement itself. But we don’t want to say that only that mass-energy displacement is causally relevant: surely we want to allow the flame of which it is a part is causally relevant; we don’t want to shrink causal relevance down to causal efficacy. The notion of causal relevance is, I believe, to be understood in terms of the notion of redundancy – in terms of the notion of a back-up mechanism. Consider the case where, as we loosely say, the presence of the flame caused the pan to heat up. Let x be the specific mass-energy displacements constitutive of the fire which, in the actual case, did the trick. The flame is causally relevant because in any case where you have the flame, but where x (for some reason) didn’t do the trick, the flame guarantees that some other mass-energy displacements y will do the trick. So, it seems, causal relevance can be understood in terms of “back-up” mechanisms. In any situation where someone or other in the vicinity coughed loud enough, but where Smith (the actual cougher) did not cough, that is enough to make Horowitz hit the wrong key. Now Smith’s wearing a yellow hat is not causally relevant to Horowitz’s erring, because it doesn’t constitute the right kind of back-up...",

But, of course, that expression has a non-technical sense; one could use it in ordinary speech, and be understood. In the non-technical sense, the Big Bang is obviously “causally relevant” to everything that is now the case, including the fact that I’m typing on a computer. In fact, give or take a few niceties relating to quantum-indeterminacy, the Big Bang was causally sufficient for that, and every other, contemporary fact. But the Big Bang is not “causally relevant” in Jackson and Pettit’s technical sense. The concept that Jackson and Pettit are labeling with the expression “causal relevance” is an important, coherent, and explanatorily fecund [71] one, and that concept deserves some kind of label. But it is easy to conflate the technical meaning of “causally relevant” with its original, nontechnical meaning. And such a conflation could easily create the illusion that the concept of causal relevance has application where it really does not. In fact, I feel that, in their application of their insights into causation to the issues under discussion, Jackson and Pettit themselves may be guilty of this sort of conflation. Let us use the expression “causally relevant JP” to refer to causal relevance in the technical Jackson-Pettit sense. And let us use the expression “causally relevant” to refer to causal relevance in the non-technical, preJackson-Pettit sense. The Big Bang is obviously causally relevant to the fact that I am not typing– after all, it is the ultimate cause: and how could it be more causally relevant than that? But the Big Bang is not causally relevant JP to my typing.

Now let us consider the paradigms through which Jackson and Pettit give meaning to their technical use of the term “causal relevance”. Horowitz hits the wrong note. What causes that to happen is Smith’s coughing or Brown’s coughing: it isn’t just someone’s coughing. (Causal efficacy resides in singular facts.)

In this paper, I wish to discuss the relation between simulating thought, on the one hand, and actually thinking, on the other. I believe that this relation has been distorted by a failure to take into account some basic facts about the conditions under which separate thoughts can combine to form a single molecular thought. Let us start with a story. At one moment, you think snow is white. At a later time, you think something is white. But your thinking something is white has nothing to do with your previously thinking snow is white. Under these circumstances, have you thought snow is white, therefore something is white? Have you thought snow is white and something is white? Have you thought any molecular proposition comprising both snow is white and something is white? “No” to all of these questions. Because your thinking snow is white didn’t have anything to do with your subsequently thinking something is white, your two thoughts didn’t “combine”, so to speak, into a single thought-process. Let us extend these remarks by telling another story. You think Socrates. [100] Later you think hit. Still later you think Plato. But your thinking Socrates has nothing to do with your thinking hit, and your thinking hit has nothing to do with your subsequently thinking Plato. Under these circumstances, have you thought Socrates hit Plato? You have not. In order to think Socrates hit Plato, it is necessary not only to have the sequence of thoughts Socrates*hit*Plato (each * is meant to indicate a break of a kind): it is necessary also that your thinking Socrates have something to do with your thinking hit and also with your thinking Plato. There is a difference between having a series of cognitive episodes, on the one hand, and having a unified thought-process, on the other. Not just any sequence of representations constitutes a thought-process. One’s thinking such and such must have something to do with one’s later thinking thus and such, if one is to think such and such, therefore thus and such or such and such and thus and such or if such and such, then such and such, and so on. These banal facts give us some leverage on a question that is anything but banal, namely: “Is there a difference between simulated thought and actual thought?”...",

There are infinitely many possible languages in which tokens morphologically identical with (A) mean aardvarks never play checkers and in which tokens morphologically identical with (B) mean aardvarks always play checkers. By itself, morphology doesn’t impose any constraints at all on logical form. So if we take into account only the morphologies of (A) and (B), and leave aside facts about their semantics, then (depending on one’s views on the arithmetic of infinite quantities) the chances of the transition from (A) to (B) being logic-tracking are either vanishingly close to zero or they are no better than 50%. Given that (A) and (B) have certain semantic profiles, it follows that the transition in question is logic-tracking. So given the operative semantic background, that transition is logical. But from the viewpoint of a purely morphology-driven being, that semantic background is non-existent. So such a being would not be acting logically in transitioning from (A) to (B). Here is a widely held position. Semantics can be “mirrored” in syntax. Thus, semantic relations like that of logical consequence are capable of a purely syntactic characterization. Syntactical facts are, in their turn, capable of a purely morphological characterization. Because of this, it is possible for purely morphology-driven operations to constitute logic-driven operations. Thus thought can be [114] “mechanized” – it can be “morphologized”. There are two points to make here. First, in light of recent work in semantics, it is pretty clear that logical form cannot be adequately mirrored in syntactic form. So even if syntactical facts were capable of a purely morphological characterization, it would not follow that logical form was capable of such a characterization. Second, and more importantly, even if logical form could be perfectly mirrored in morphology, that would be irrelevant to the prospect of “morphologizing” (or otherwise “mechanizing”) thought. Let us start with the second point. In English, sentences that seem to have the same syntax may diverge in logical form. “Bill is a green duck, therefore Bill is duck” is valid; “Bill is a decoy duck, therefore Bill is a duck” is not valid. For this reason, we are told that, in natural languages, syntactic identities conceal differences in logical form: in English, a given syntactic form can (supposedly) be...",

First some background. Putnam showed that one’s concepts of objects – one’s abilities to have thoughts about objects -- often have a causal component. At least a part of one’s concept of water or of Bob consists in there being some kind of causal connection between oneself and those things. [117] Putnam showed this through thought-experiments like this one. Twin-John and John are molecule for molecule duplicates of each other. So John and Twin-John are exactly alike leaving aside facts about the (distal) causes of their conditions. Given this, suppose that John has a visual sensation that is caused by Bob, and that twin-John has a qualitatively identical visual sensation that is caused by twin-Bob. John is perceiving Bob, not twin-Bob. And twin-John is perceiving twin-Bob, not Bob. From his perception, John thus ‘uploads’ a concept of Bob, not of twin-Bob. And from his perception, [118] twin-John uploads a concept of twin-Bob, and not of Bob. The fact that John has a concept of Bob, and not twin-Bob, derives from the fact that John has a causal connection to Bob that he doesn’t have to twinBob. And the same thing mutatis mutandis explains why twin-John has a concept of twin-Bob, and not of Bob. Thus John has thoughts about Bob in virtue of (at least in part) his having a certain causal connection to Bob. Thus John’s concept of Bob – his ability to have thoughts about Bob – consists, at least in part, in his having a certain causal connection to Bob. (The same thing is true mutatis mutandis of twinJohn and twin-Bob.) In this way, Putnam (successfully) shows that a causal connection to an object may be, at the very least, a part of one’s concept of that object. In many publications, Jerry Fodor says our concepts of objects consist in [119] causal relations of a certain kind between ourselves and objects. As [120] we’ll see in a moment, Donald Davidson takes the same view. I now want to show that this view of Davidson’s seriously lead him astray in his analysis of a famous problem posed by Alan Turing. 3. Turing posed the following problem.

    "text": "* I should qualify something said earlier. We’ve seen that Davidson’sattack on Turing doesn’t go through. We’ve also seen that this fact gives some credence to a conception of intelligence (or rationality) that is different from the traditional one. (The traditional one is: intelligence consists in some kind of proposition-manipulating ability.) But the spuriousness of Davidson’s attack by no means proves that intelligence is not to be thought of the traditional way. As I suggested earlier, whenever one is grasping some object-dependent proposition, one is also, it seems, grasping many existential propositions. When I see Toonces the cat chasing Fido the dog, I am aware of some object-dependent fact, namely Toonces is chasing Fido. But necessarily involved in this grasp is a grasp of various existential propositions. I don’t just see Toonces; perception, and representational mental activity generally, is predicational; I must see Toonces as having certain properties (as having fur of a certain color, as being four-legged, as being a certain distance from me, and so on). So my visual awareness of Toonces seems to mediated by propositions (or, in any case, by information) that is existential (there is a four-legged creature with thus and such properties…running after a fourlegged creature with such and such properties). Now notice that, where the proposition Toonces is chasing Fido is object-involving with respect to a certain cat and a certain dog, the just mentioned existential propositions are not thus object-involving: there is a creature with pointy ears…chasing a creature with floppy ears…is not object-involving, at least not with respect to either Toonces or Fido. Basically, ‘existentializing’ a proposition tends to get rid of the objects in that proposition; by replacing Toonces with a variable, and then prefixing the resulting open proposition with an existential quantifier, one turns a proposition that is object-involving with respect to a certain thing into one that is not object-involving with respect to that thing. It thus seems that if an object-involving proposition could be completely ‘existentialized’ (i.e. if each spatio-temporal object implicated in that proposition could be subject to the procedure we just described), the result would, of course, be a completely object-independent proposition. And a completely object-independent proposition is one the grasping of which does supervenes on one’s brain-states considered apart form their causal origins (or, if you prefer, if on one’s mental states narrowly individuated).

(iii) is formally true. A purely syntaxdriven transition from “Fred is an elephant” to “Fred is either an elephant or an aardvark” constitutes a valid inference. It is a computation. The syntax of an expression is its form. Ultimately, form reduces to [136] morphology. Morphology is shape. Shape is entirely physical. A morphology-driven process is an entirely physics-driven process. But some morphology-driven processes are also inferences: they are formal inferences; they are computations. So entirely physics-driven processes can qualify as inferences: they can qualify as things which can meaningfully and even correctly be described in normative terms – as right or wrong, justified or unjustified. So it is easy to dissolve the paradox mentioned above. We advocate CTM: we assume that brains (or brains-cum-bodies) are environments that house morphology-driven interactions among symbols. Such interactions are purely physics-driven, but they also qualify as inferences of a certain kind: formal inferences – inferences that embody sensitivity to syntactic, and thus to logical, form. Because of the tight relation between an expression’s logical form and its syntax, and between its syntax and its morphology, it follows that entirely morphology-driven operations can constitute inferences, and thus cognitive achievements, of a certain kind. So CTM dissolves the paradox [137] [138] mentioned a while ago. the purpose of this paper I wish to show that the line of thought just presented is entirely spurious. There are many problems with it. One problem is that it involves a confusion of two entirely different meanings of the word “form”. There is form in the syntactic sense, and there is form in the physical sense. These two things have practically nothing to do with each other. Any connections between them are exceedingly indirect. Two physical entities that have exactly the same syntactic form can have nothing in common at the level of morphology. And two morphologically identical physical entities can have nothing in common at the level of syntax. So morphology-driven operations, though “formal” in one sense of the word, are by no means syntax-driven. Genuinely syntax-driven operations can involve sensitivity to morphology (in the sense [139] of physical shape); but, as we will see, sensitivity to morphology plays a decidedly subordinate role in genuinely...",

By reasoning similar to that given a moment ago, the “not” in (vii) can be seen as denoting that second-level function. On similar grounds, Frege argued that quantifiers [145] denote second level functions. (“For some x” denotes a function that assigns truth to an open sentence exactly if some object satisfies it; “for all x” denotes a function that assigns truth to an open sentence or propositional function exactly if nothing fails to satisfy it.) Richard Montague generalized [146] Frege’s analysis to other connectives. Many contemporary linguists and philosophers of language (myself included) see tense- and case-markers as denoting second level functions. Despite years of tradition to the contrary, the distinction between categorematic and syncategorematic items – lexical and non-lexical items – is plausibly seen as a distinction within the class of referring terms. “Or”, “not”, and the like, denote second level functions; “Fred”, “rabbit”, and the like denote individuals or first order functions.

So it makes dubious sense to regard syntax-driven operations as fundamental. tokens versus types Sentence-types are abstract objects, and therefore do not have morphology. Sentence-tokens are what have morphology. The sentence-type “I am tired” has no morphology. But any given token of that sentence has morphology. But even though it is sentence-tokens, not sentence-types, that have morphology, two tokens of a given sentence-type can have absolutely nothing in common at the level of morphology. “I am tired” can be tokened by noises, ink-marks, hand-signals, light-beams, or smoke-signals.

In this argument, the tense-marker appears to have little or no role; and, in [156] this case, there is (at least arguably, though not in my view) a straightforward mapping of syntax onto logical truth. The problem is that most sentences are not like this. If you pick an utterance of yours at random (“everybody’s here”, “I don’t think there will be a party tomorrow”, “you told me that Adam Smith never told his wife he loved her”), it will probably be replete with context-sensitive components; and, for reasons earlier discussed, semantics is needed to bridge the yawning gap between syntactic and logical form. The arguments in logic books are tendentiously chosen to lack such components. If only for the sake of argument, let us suppose that our thinking does consist in syntax-driven operations on expressions; and let be [157] “Mentalese” be our name for the language to which those expressions belong. Let us evaluate this supposition in light of the points just made about context-sensitivity. If our thinking consists in purely syntax-driven operations on expressions, then either those operations will not be logic-tracking, for the reasons just discussed, or the expressions on which they are performed must lack the context-sensitivity characteristic of most natural language sentences. So CTM, in its need to have syntax track logic, requires that Mentalese sentences be frozen and context-insensitive – that they lack the contextsensitivity characteristic of their natural language analogues. But if Mentalese consisted entirely of frozen, eternal sentences, then it is hard to see how it could be of much utility to its user: what the organism needs to know is specifically indexical; it doesn’t need (merely) “eternal” information; it needs [158] [159] egocentric knowledge of the here and now. To sum up, if Mentalese comprised only context-insensitive sentences, it would be incapable of mediating just the kind of information that the survival of the organism depends on.

Given that materialism is correct, but that type-type materialism is incorrect, it follows that what makes something x qualify as (e.g.) a belief that snow is white or a pain or a desire for water is not that x is made out of this or that type of material: x’s compositional properties, as we might put it, are not what make it qualify as (e.g.) a desire for water. What kinds of properties does a physical state of affairs or object have apart from its compositional properties? Well, such things also have causal properties.

It wouldn’t be hard to create something that, to a high degree of approximation, had the same causal properties as the carburetor in your car, but was made out of a completely different kind of material.

At first glance, (B) looks like the kind of proposition that might be necessary. If that is the case, then our analysis is false. The truth is that our analysis does not put us on the wrong side of any modal facts. Let us consider the operator necessarily. This operator can combine in different ways with (B): more exactly, it can be given varying degrees of scope. (B1) Necessarily: something x is uniquely a last celestial body to disappear from the morning sky, and x is identical with a unique a last celestial body to disappear from the morning sky.

But this seems wrong: for there doesn’t seem to be any that anyone has to think of Hesperus. For reasons we’ve seen, it seems that cognitively “locking onto” a thing O involves knowing some proposition of the form something x uniquyely has phi, where O has phi. But after that lock-on has been established, I don’t have to think about O by way of that proposition. I can drop the proposition. Suppose that I lock onto...",

[1] “The Emotive Meaning of Ethical Terms” in Logical Positivism ed. A.J. Ayer The Free Press 1959 NO SUCH THINGS AS MENTALESE Abstract According to Jerry Fodor, for someone to grasp a proposition – to have a thought – is just for some sentence of an internal language to be tokened. This internal language is thus the ‘language of thought’. In this essay I will provide some reasons to think that this idea is untenable. For someone to know a language L, that person must know the rules giving meaning to the expressions of L. (Admittedly, this idea may be questioned; but reasons are provided for it.) So for someone to know the language of thought, he must know the rules which assign meaning to the expressions belonging to that language. Now we know from Tarski that no language can express the rules that give its own expressions meaning. So if one is to grasp the semantical rules for some language L, one must either grasp them (i) in some ‘Meta’-language (that comprises L as a proper part of itself) or (ii) one must grasp them in some altogether non-linguistic form. Someone who holds that all thinking consists in the tokening of symbols cannot take path (ii). So he must take path (i). This means that if one is to understand a language L, one must understand the relevant meta-language and, therefore, must grasp the rules that give meaning to the expressions of this meta-language. But by Tarski’s theorem, these rules cannot be given in the meta-language itself. So if one is to grasp these rules – and, therefore, if one is to understand the meta-language – these rules must be given to one either (i’) in some meta-meta-language or (ii’) in some nonlinguistic form. If we adopt path (ii’) we are abandoning the idea that thinking consists in the tokening...",

But you don’t really understand the sentence, at least not in the sense in which a Finn does. For you have no idea what contribution the various components of (i) make to the proposition expressed by that sentence. So at least one of the dimensions of (i)’s meaning that is known to any Finn is unknown to you. We can characterize this difference by saying that for you (i) is a primitive expression, whereas for a Finn (i) is a highly complex expression. So even though the proposition expressed by (i) is complex, nevertheless the sentence itself is, from your point view (though not a Finn’s), semantically primitive: for, from your point of view (though not a Finn’s) its meaning is not to be arrived by performing a computation on the meanings of simpler expressions. Now suppose that Fodor is right: suppose that you (or the relevant subpersonal agency within you) doesn’t understand Mentalese sentences by consulting any set of rules; that you are simply ‘so constructed’ that you understand them. (Incidentally, the understanding of Mentalese sentences, if there are such things, occurs at an entirely sub-personal level. So, strictly speaking, it is incorrect to speak of you processing such sentences; for this term obviously refers to a person, and not to a network of sub-personal computational processes. But for brevity’s sake, I will speak of ‘you’ grasping, processing etc. Mentalese sentences. Simply realize that, in these contexts, I am using the term ‘you’ to refer to some sub-personal entity within you.) This means that, given any Mentalese sentence S, you don’t compute its meaning.

And, of course, your ‘integrating’ these meanings consists in your applying some set of rules that are defined over these meanings. In light of this, consider the Mentalese sentence: (i’) If snow is white, and all cows eat snow, and all things that eat white things like grass, then cows like grass. One would presume that you can understand (i’) by virtue of understanding the Mentalese sentences (ii’) snow is white (iii’) all cows eat snow; (iv’) all things that eat white things like grass; and (v’) cows like grass. But if Fodor is right, this is not the case. If Fodor is right, (i’) is not – at least nor from your point of view: from the point of view the person who has to figure out what (i’) means - semantically complex; its meaning is not to be computed in any way. For computation involves consideration of rules, and Fodor’s way of blocking the regress discussed above is to say that one understands Mentalese sentences without consulting any rules. A fortiori, as far as you can tell –- for, if Fodor’s objection is correct, you have no access to the recursions relating (i’) to (ii’)-(v’) -- (i’)’s meaning is not a function of the meanings of (ii’)-(v’). But this idea is multiply incoherent. For Fodor – for anyone who believes that there is a language of thought - grasping the proposition snow is white simply is grasping the Mentalese sentence (ii’) snow is white, and grasping the proposition If snow is white, and all cows eat snow, and all things that eat white things like grass, then cows like grass simply is grasping the Mentalese sentence (i’) If snow is white, and all cows eat snow, and all things that eat white things like grass, then cows like grass. For Fodor, you have no way of grasping the propositions other than by grasping these sentences of Mentalese. (This is what the whole ‘language-of-thought’ hypothesis amounts to.) Now there’s obviously no way to grasp the proposition (i) without grasping (ii)-(v): your grasp of (i) is surely ‘built up’ in some way from your grasp of (ii)-(v).

By contrast, my feeling of thirst and your perception of the ice-water do not belong to the same mind. Supposing that the bundle theory is correct, what is it that makes two mental contents belong to the same mind? The proponent of (**) has no trouble dealing with this problem: two mental belongs to the same mind just in case they are had by the same self. But the bundle theorist cannot avail himself of this response. If he did, his position would be circular. According to the bundle theorist, a self just is certain class of mental contents. So for a mental content to belong to a certain self is just for that mental content to have a certain relation to other mental contents. Let R be this relationship, whatsoever it might turn out to be. R cannot be defined in terms of the notion of f ‘being had by the same self’ since, for the bundle theorist, it is this very relation that R is meant to explain. So the bundle theorist must say what R is without helping himself to the notion of ‘belonging to the same self.’ But there is no way – or, at any rate, no non-circular way -- to do this. With regard to every attempt to define R independently of the notion of being had by the same self, every such attempt has failed outright or has involved some kind of covert circularity.

For an inference to be made is not just for one belief to cause another belief to occur: the contents of those beliefs must be implicated in a certain way. My believing P and Q could cause me to believe R without my inferring R from P and Q. My brain might just be wired in such a way that, if I believe P and Q, then I automatically believe R. (Or a belief in P and Q might generate a belief in R by way of purely associative or emotional, as opposed to rational, processes.) For me to infer R from [P and Q], I must see the bearing of [P and Q] on R.

So suppose that B1 is my belief in the conjunctive proposition [P and Q], and that B2 is my belief in R. For me to really infer R from [P and Q], it is not enough that B1 cause B2 to occur.

We see that Smith is bald or we sense-perceive evidence of his baldness. But how do we know of the truth of what is said by “triangles have three sides”? We obviously don’t know it by inspecting triangular objects. It isn’t through empirical research that we know it.

For empiricism is, by definition, the view that all knowledge is acquired through the senses. One way empiricists have dealt with necessary truths is by turning them into linguistic truths. Sentences like “triangles have three sides” are plausibly seen as being true “by definition”. If one were to say “triangles do not have [280] three sides”, one would be “sinning against language”, as Ayer put it ; one would be using words in deviant ways.

What I’d like to do now is to show that, unless one believes in propositions – unless one believes that, in addition to tables and chairs and iguanas, there are propositions – one must advocate this false theory. Let us refer to people who believe in propositions as “propositionalists”, and to people who do not as “anti-propositionalists”. Once again consider the sentence: (T) “Triangles have three sides.” A propositionalist says: (T) is necessarily true because it has for its meaning a necessarily true proposition, namely: triangles have three sides. That proposition is made true by facts about mind-independent concepts. The concepts triangle, and three and side are so interrelated that (T) must come out true, given that it bears the proposition triangles have three sides. So language makes (T) be true only in the sense that it associates that sentence with a necessarily true proposition. That proposition is true independently of anything having to do with language. An anti-propositionalist cannot say that. He cannot say that what makes (T) be necessary is that it is associated with a necessarily true proposition. For the anti-propositionalist doesn’t believe in propositions at all. So the antipropositionalist has to figure out some other way of answering the question: What makes (T) be true? What options does the anti-propositionalist have? He cannot say that (T) is made true by facts about the interrelations of platonic entities – of properties or concepts (in the non-psychological sense). Why can he not say this? To take this line would be to grant the existence of propositions. Presumably, the proposition triangles have three sides, if it exists, just is some structure consisting of the concepts (or properties) triangle, side, and so forth; so it just is these objects, interrelated in a certain way. So if an anti-propositionalist says that interrelations among platonic entities are what make (T) be true, then he is conceding that propositions do exist, and he is no longer an antipropositionalist. Surely triangles have three sides, if it exists at all, is built up out of the concepts triangle, three, side and so on. The propositions triangles have three sides and Jim’s pool has the shape of a triangle – if they exist at all -have something in common, corresponding to the fact that triangle is a constituent of both of...",

The difference in distal cause makes for a [291] difference in content. But this difference in content seems to be inert. What does all the work is local: the spatially and temporally local properties of Smith’s brain are what cause him to pick up the phone and dial those numbers; the same is true (mutatis mutandis) of Twin-Smith. The differences in distal causes are causally irrelevant: everything that does causal work is in the here and now – is lodged inside Smith’s and twin-Smith’s respective crania. It is irrelevant [292] that Smith’s state was distally caused by Mary, as opposed to twinMary or hologram-Mary or Robo-Mary.

CTM is a form of materialism, for reasons that will become clear. One would think that this doctrine would be informed by the same intellectual progressiveness that led to the creation and subsequent development of computer science. And, because of its liberal and confident use of words such as “compute” and “algorithm,” CTM has an impressive sheen of rigor.

In general, when the context-sensitive expressions in a true statement are replaced with context-insensitive expressions, the result is a statement that, although true, neither entails the first statement not follows from it. For an expression to be context-sensitive is for its referent to vary with the context. What an expression refers to is determined by its semantics, not its syntax. CTM says that thought is to no degree semantics-driven. If that were true, we couldn't grasp perspectival truths, such as that expressed by (i). Since we can grasp such truths, CTM is false. 5.0 CTM’s reliance on the erroneous assumption that there are minimal units of thought First a definition: a “morpheme” is an expression that cannot be decomposed into others. Bearing this in mind, let’s suppose that, just as CTM says, we think in a language. In that case, our concepts are identical with expressions. Linguistic expressions consist of morphemes. (Any given complex expression; e.g., “the cat is on the mat,” decomposes into expressions that cannot, in their turn, be further decomposed; (e.g., “cat,” “mat”). So in contending that our thoughts are identical with (tokens of) Mentalese symbols, CTM is, in effect, assuming that we have simple concepts: concepts that cannot be decomposed in others. So CTM, if correct, entails that any given thought that one has can be decomposed into “simple” concepts. CTM thus has the radically implausible consequence that we have “simple” concepts. In other words, CTM has the consequence that some of our concepts are no more capable of being decomposed into other concepts than a morpheme (e.g., the word “cat”) can be decomposed into other expressions. If this consequence of CTM is correct, it follows, as we’ll now see, that some of our concepts would be such that one could have them without also having other concepts. Let T be the token of the Mentalese word for “snow” that went off when, just a moment ago, I thought to myself that snow is white. We may assume that T is a morpheme. (If, for some reason, you reject that assumption, just map what we say about T onto some Mentalese expression-token that, in your judgment, is a morpheme—and you must, if you grant that we think in...",

I couldn’t possibly have a concept of snow, or of Barack Obama, or (to take a more tendentious example) of the number three without having a network of other concepts---extension, spatiotemporal location, surface-area, sentience, etc. Concepts are necessarily contrastive; in order to have a concept of a thing, one has to be able to distinguish that thing from other things. A prerequisite for distinguishing a given rock from a given tree is my being aware of some property had by the rock that isn’t had by the tree. And a prerequisite for my having such knowledge is my already having concepts. 5.1.1 How some contemporary philosophers would response to this argument Many contemporary theorists---some of them CTM-advocates, some of them not—reject this line of thought, saying that, to have a “fix,” on the rock (or the tree), I need only be on the receiving end of a causal series beginning with it. Their view is that concepts are mental photographs. The relationship borne by my concept of Socrates with respect to Socrates himself is identical with the relationship borne by a photograph of Barack Obama with respect to the events (the impact of certain light-rays with Barack Obama’s body) that, in due course, led to that photograph.

Given that information, along with other pieces of background information that I have, I can make various inferences. I can infer that, at some point, light bounced off of a person who was bald and was wearing a toga (and so on). So the photographic plate is information in the sense that, to a creature with the requisite background and the requisite intelligence, its existence warrants the making of an inference that will eventuate in knowledge of some entity (e.g., a person) or state of affairs (e.g., one consisting of a person wearing a toga) that might otherwise have remained unknown. (Why “might otherwise have been unknown,” instead of “would otherwise have been unknown”? Because I might have been the one who took the picture and might therefore have already known of the person and the corresponding state of affairs.) The discolorations on the photographic plate are “information” in the sense that, to a suitably endowed creature, they warrant the making of inferences that, in due course, lead to concepts. In any case, it is massively to CTM’s discredit that it presupposes that there are representational atoms. 5.2 A similar argument Sentences are digital structures. Setting aside cases of ambiguity, any given sentence—any given complex expression, in fact---has a unique decomposition into minimal units of significance. This means, as previously pointed out, that our thoughts decompose into minimal representational units. Which is radically implausible. In any case, sense-perceptions don’t have a digital structure, and neither, it would seem to follow, does the information that sense-perceptions encode. Given which, it would be very artificial to maintain that all post-perceptual cognition was digital or, therefore, sentential in nature. But, for argument’s sake, let’s suppose that the contents of our senseperceptions can, as some advocates of CTM maintain, be “digitized.” Supposing this hypothesis correct, all the problems previously posed for CTM by perceptual content are now posed by the post-perceptual thoughts involved in this (alleged) digitization-process. If I’m translating from Albanian to English, I must speak both Albanian and English. Moreover, supposing that I’m translating competently, I have some way of evaluating the degree to which my English outputs match my Albanian inputs.

Taken in the first way, it does nothing more than affirm a purely de facto concomitance of two properties (viz. the property of being heated metal and the property of being something that expands). Taken in the second way, MH seems to say that all heated metal expands, the reason being that a thing’s being heated metal provides some kind of nomic basis for its expanding. In this section,...",

Thus, relative to what linguists mean by “syntax” (and “syntactic,” etc.), it’s a non-starter to say that “formal truth” is syntactic truth.

Given any expression in (1) other than the logical constants in it (viz., “either . . . or . . .” and “not”), replacing that expression with another belonging to the same grammatical category results in truth. There are two problems with Quine’s analysis. First, it doesn’t say what is so special about those items; it doesn’t say what these so-called “logical constants” have in common with one another that other expressions not on the list don’t have in common with them. And until that information is provided, there’s nothing to prevent one from extending that list in arbitrary ways. Unless that list was generated by some rule, anything can be added to it without diminishing its integrity, since it has no integrity to begin with. But if it was generated by some rule, then Quine’s answer fails to identify it and thus fails to say what formal truth is. An analogy may help. When asked to define the expression “number,” I simply list the various different kinds of numbers (“real,” “whole,” “rational,” “imaginary,” etc.). Have I answered the question? No. Even though I’ve listed the various different kinds of numbers, I haven’t said what numbers are, and I thus haven’t provided any reason why fractions are on that list but birds are not. Accordingly, my answer doesn’t give anyone a reason not to extend that list as he or she pleases—not to decide that birds and rocks are numbers. Of course, nobody would extend the list in such an absurd way.

It is in virtue not only of its form, but also of what is meant by “for any propositions P, Q, and R” that (A) is true. (A) and (B) have the same form. What distinguishes them is that, in the place where (B) contains an occurrence of one expression (“for no propositions P, Q, and R”), (A) contains an expression with a different meaning (“for any propositions P, Q, and R”). So the fact that A is analytic, whereas B is not, cannot possibly be chalked up to the fact that one is formally true, whereas the other is not. Thus, not all analytic truth is formal truth. In the TLP, Wittgenstein[360] says that all analytic truth is formal truth. Wittgenstein is wrong, for the reasons just given. Also, even if there were some formally true sentence S such that S was equivalent with (A), the statement (in this context you make take \"statement\" to mean \"sentence,” \"sentence-token,” or \"proposition\"): (C) S is equivalent with A. would not itself be a formal truth. To be a formal truth is to be a consequence of an informally true universal generalization. The sentence: (%) if grass is green and snow is white and roses are red, then roses are red is a formal truth because it is a consequence of (A).

But it isn’t a formal truth, since it has the same form as: (NTB) any case of knowledge is a case of unjustified false belief, which is false.

In general, informal truths are needed to establish whether a given sentence is formally true or not. It’s only on the basis of informal truths that it can be determined whether a given truth is formal or not. In other words, if formal truth is logical truth, then it’s only on the basis of non-logical truths that it can be determined whether a given statement is formally true or not---a statement’s being logically true would be a non-logical consequence of some non-logical truth. But in that case, the term “logic” wouldn’t refer to the body of truths with respect to which the legitimacy of an inference or argument is to be evaluated; it would refer to specific applications of those truths. It would refer to the consequences of contingent truths. More precisely, it would refer to truths, e.g. the consequent of (iii), that follow from truths, e.g. the antecedent of (iii) that describe linguistic conventions that happen to hold but needn’t do so. Be it noted that, although the consequent of (iii) follows necessarily from the antecedent, the antecedent is contingent and so is the consequent. It is a contingent fact, as we’ve noted, that (for any appropriate value of P) “if P, then not-not P” is an expression, let alone a true one, let alone a formally true one.

So if logical truth coincided with formal truth, the truths recognized and operated on by those gifted with logical acumen would in all cases be contingent.

Quine’s analysis, we noted, is vitiated by his failing to say what conditions an expression must satisfy to be a “logical constant.” We are in position to provide this information. The expressions “not” and “if . . . then . . .” are on Quine’s list of logical constants, and those expressions occur in: (5) If Smith is at home, then it’s not the case that Smith is not at home. Before we proceed, we have to make a couple of points about the word “not.” That word not is known as a “sentence-level operator”: it’s an expression that forms sentences out of sentences—it forms “snow is not white” out of “snow is white.” It isn’t often that sentence-level operators are replaced with variables. But not only can such replacements be made; they must be made. Otherwise, it would be impossible to express any generalization about sentence-level connectives. (Logicians and linguists often make statements about whole classes of sentence-level connectives, and such statements involve replacements of this kind, since they have the form: “given any sentence level connective X . . .”) In fact, we’re about to state just such a principle right now. Given (5), if we replace “not” with a variable, the result is: (5 X) If Smith is at home, then it’s X the case that Smith is X at home. If we bind the free variable with a universal quantifier of the appropriate kind, the result is: (5 XUG) Given any sentence-level operator X, if Smith is at home, then it’s X the case that Smith is X at home, which is false, the reason being that some sentence-level operators lack the relevant property. An example of such an operator is the word “necessarily.” When this word replaces the variable in (5X), the result is: (5 XN) If Smith is at home, then it’s necessarily the case that Smith is necessarily at home, which is false. Another expression on Quine’s list that occurs in (5) is “if . . . then . . .” This expression, like “not,” is a sentence-level operator. But whereas “not” is a one-placed sentence-connective, “if . . . then . . .” is a two-place sentence connective. So, whereas “not” assigns...",

In actuality, they are questions of logic, not of empirical fact. Moreover, each of (a)–(c) is logically false and therefore [368] couldn’t possibly be correct. Let’s discuss (a) first. In this chapter, we have seen that anything that persists for any amount of time is a causal series. A causal series is a continuous series of states of affairs such that, given any two of them, one is the (in)direct cause of the other. An illustration may be helpful. At any given moment during its existence, your car consists of an incessant flurry of mass-energy displacements; and your car is thus a series of “event-flurries,” as we’ll call them. Twenty-four hours ago, your car was constituted by one event-flurry. Right now it’s constituted by a different event-flurry. (Let S1 be the first event-flurry and let S2 be the second.) And, of course, my car is currently constituted by some event-flurry. (Let S3 be that flurry.) Bearing all of this in mind, imagine the following. While your car was parked in your driveway, somebody crashed into it, severely damaging it. Your car therefore bears little resemblance to what it was twenty-four hours ago. It follows that S1 and S2 are qualitatively very different from each other. By contrast, S1 and S3 are as similar to each other as their being in different places permits. This is sheer coincidence: S1 and S3 are, we will suppose, as causally disconnected from each other as any two non-simultaneous events on this planet can be. It follows that my car, as it is right now, is just like your car, as it was twenty-four hours ago, before it was damaged. It also follows that S1 is much less similar to S2 than it is to S3. Be all of this as it may, the car in your driveway is, whereas the car in my driveway is not, numerically identical with the car you owned twenty-four hours ago. Mediating between S1 and S2 is a continuous series of events such that, given any two of them, one is the (in)direct cause of the other. No such series mediates between S1 and S3.

A question will help clarify the reasoning behind this last assertion: Where is Smith during that fourteen year interval? He’s either nowhere or he’s somewhere. Let’s suppose that he’s nowhere. In that case, for the reasons illustrated in connection with your car, whatever it is that pops into existence in the year 2023 isn’t numerically identical with Smith. So let’s suppose that he’s somewhere— that, at any given instant during that time period, he is in some place or other. But in that case he’s no more time-traveling than anything else that exists during that interval. If he’s next to some one tree during that entire period, he’s no more time-traveling than that tree. If he’s going from place to place, he’s no more time-traveling than any one of the satellites that will orbit the [369] earth during that period. So depending on whether he’s somewhere or nowhere, Smith is either permanently annihilated in 2009 or he’s no more time-traveling than anything else that exists during that period. Therefore, (i) is false. To see why (ii) is false we need do little more than repeat some of the points just made. Suppose that Smith travels from 2009 to 2023 at a rate of one million minutes/minute. We’ve just seen that Smith cannot make this journey in a discontinuous manner; he cannot disappear from one time and reappear at some other, non-adjacent time. So Smith must make this journey in a continuous manner. So at any given moment during this interval, Smith must be in some place or other. It follows, as we saw a moment ago, that he is no more time-traveling than anything else that exists during that interval. The supposition that Smith is traveling forward in time at a rate of one million minutes/minute thus turns out to collapse into the supposition that he isn’t time-traveling at all. Given any positive number n, an analogous argument shows that continuous forward time-travel at a rate of n minutes/minute collapses into forward time-travel at a rate of one minute/minute. There is another, quite different problem with the concept of discontinuous time-travel.

Also, given obvious adaptations of what we said a moment ago, there is no conceivable event that, were it known, would provide more support for (1) than for (2). Since, therefore, there couldn’t possibly be any observation-based reason for preferring (1) to (2), the only possible reasons for doing so would be of a logical nature. This means that there are no reasons for doing so, given that (1) is incoherent. The concept of discontinuous backwards time-travel is therefore a broken one. What about the idea of continuous backwards time-travel? For argument’s sake, let’s suppose that, during his continuous journey from the year 1985 to the year 1955, Marty McFly is right next to some stop-sign that was built in 1920 and stays in the same place for several centuries. That means that, at any given moment during that thirty year period, Marty McFly is no more time-traveling than the stop-sign. Each is just sitting there. There are, of course, some important differences between Mary McFly and the stop-sign. First of all, whereas the stop-sign is crushed or burnt or otherwise destroyed in some pedestrian way, Marty McFly must simply vanish in the year 1985. (If he doesn’t, then he’s still hanging around in the year 1985, in which case he obviously hasn’t gone back in time.) And, whereas the stop-sign’s presence in the year 1955 is to be explained in the customary way, Marty McFly just popped up ex nihilo. Bearing these points in mind, let W3 be a universe in which: (3) Marty McFly continuously traveled backwards in time from the year 1985 to the year 1955 but is otherwise unchanged. is true, and in which (2) is false; and let W4 be a universe that is exactly like W3 except that, in it, (2) is true and (3) is false. Echoing what we said earlier, there is no conceivable event that, were it known, would enable one to determine whether one was in W3 as opposed to W4, or vice versa.

Be it noted that it is events (or conditions) that have causes, whereas it is propositions that have justifications. Whether (i) is true is not the concern of this paper. Until I recently heard a lecture by Paul Humphries, I accepted (ii). I now reject, on the basis (partly) [373] of what Humphries said. What I wll say, though in some m ways a development of what Humphreys said, is not Humphries-exegesis, incorporating into it large elements of my own reactions to his talk. Humphreys’ denial of (ii) consisted in his advocating the contention that: (H) a given event E1 can cause (or the affirmation of its existence can justify) the occurrence (or affirmation thereof) of an event E2, even if, given E1’s occurrence, there was only an n% chance (where n is any number greater than 1 and less than 100) of E2’s occurrence. I believe H correct and would like to defend it, borrowing heavily (to say the least) in my attempt to do so from Humphries’ argument. A preliminary argument. Complying with laws is different from being governed by them. Everything complies with the laws of microphysics; and, presumably, all higher level laws (assuming such thing to exist, which I will argue they do) they hold in virtue of microphysical laws. But consider this. We have two houses that are architecturally identical, meaning that they way in which their medium sized parts (their constituent bricks, planks, etc.) are interrelated are identical. Despite that fact, the microphysical structure of any component of either house is completely different from the corresponding structure of any component of the other house. However, these differences have no bearing on the dynamic interrelations on the bricks, planks, etc. which those microrealities constitute. Both houses fall. They both fall for the same reason. That reason has nothing to do with the microstructures of their parts. It has to do with the fact that some plank wasn’t properly nailed to some other plank, or some such. The mechanical (Newtonian, macro-level) laws involved in both cases were the same. At the same time, in both cases, those laws were operative only because of facts about the relevant microconstituents, which, of course, obey a completely different set of laws.

It’s a theoretical possibility that two situations that, from a Newtonian perspective are indistinguishable, could (ceteris paribus) have different outcomes---because of some quantum event that happened to ramify outside the normal sphere of influence of such events.

So far as we did say such a thing, it would be shorthand for some unwieldy, but correct, microphysical statement. But if we went with (c), we’d make it impossible to produce precisely the sort of explanatory meaningful generalization discussed earlier in connection with the two houses. Which means that we’d make it impossible to produce otherwise easily identified and illuminating explanations. Here we have a choice. We can say either (#) The structural (non-microphysical) defects in the houses caused them to collapse’ or (##) Those defects did not cause those houses to collapse, since causes operate with 100% efficacy, and those defects don’t always lead to outcomes such as those described. If we go with (#), we satisfy the explanatory desiderata described earlier. If we go with (##), we hold onto our a priori belief that, if E2 results from E1, then, given E1, E2 couldn’t have failed to occur. This position, though not to be jettisoned lightly, is so inimical to explanation that it must, in fact, be jettisoned. Newton’s laws, even after recent development in physics are taken into account, hold almost 100% of the time. So let’s consider some laws (or ‘principles,’ if you consider my use of the word ‘law’ question-begging) that are very obviously probabilistic. Smoking causes cancer. This would seem to be a law, or principle, of sorts. But less than 30% of smokers get lung cancer. Nonetheless, if asked, “why did Jerry get lung cancer?,” We are (let’s assume) correctly answering the question by saying “because he smoked 4 packs a day.” So here we can say that (E1) Jerry’s heavy smoking caused (E2) Jerry’s cancer, even though events relevantly like E1 have only a small chance of bringing about evnetws relevantly like E2. Let us now suppose that Larry smokes as much as Jerry but doesn’t get cancer. In that case, it’s hard to see how E1’s being the cause of E2 could be maintained. “What we must say,” it will be said, “is that E1 did not by itself cause E2---that there was some other factor.” I agree. There was surely some other factor. (To facilitate discussion, let’s suppose that other factor to be one that falls totally outside the reach of medicine—that it...",

(Ap) Smith punches Jones is a proposition. (Bp) Smith, the relation of punching, Jones is not. A proposition is not a heap of objects and properties. A proposition is a set of objects and properties that are unified in some way. But how must they be unified? In what does the “unity of the proposition” lie? This question has never been adequately answered. I believe that our analysis of propositions gives us an answer to this question. § Frege’s answer was to say that, in a proposition, certain items are “unsaturated”: they have holes in them. These holes enable the items in the proposition to link together in the right way. In (A), the expression “punches” corresponds to something with holes in it; these holes enable Smith and Jones to link up with that thing in the appropriate way. By contrast, in (B), the thing corresponding to “the relation of punching” doesn’t have the right number of holes in it; so it doesn’t appropriately link up with Bob and Smith. Frege’s “solution” is really just a way of labeling the problem, as Davidson [380] said. Obviously we aren’t talking about physical holes. We are talking about holes in a metaphorical sense. What we want to know – what Frege doesn’t tell us – is what this metaphor is a metaphor for. The difference between (A) and (B) obviously has something to do with the fact that the first has grammar, whereas the second does not. In the first, there are inflections. (I will argue later some of these are not phonetically apparent.) In the second, nothing is inflected. The difference between a proposition and a non-propositional heap is somehow coded in these grammatical articulations. The question is: what exactly these articulations do? Do they themselves refer to entities of some kind? Does the “-s” on “punches” refer to some mysterious entity – perhaps to kind of function? Is that why (A) encodes a proposition while (B) does not? Are grammatical articulations referring terms with the special property that the things to which they refer confer unity on what would otherwise an unordered heap? Or do grammatical articulations not refer to anything? Do they exert their unifying influence in some other way? § Let me start...",

I believe that (iii) is closer to the truth. But, first, I don’t think it is quite correct. (As I will argue, that Smith punches Jones is not an arrangement involving Smith and Jones per se, but the properties of being identical with Smith and Jones, respectively.) But leaving aside this last point, (ii) is woefully incomplete. Suppose propositions are arrangements of individuals and properties. We still need to know two things. First, what is the relevant kind of arranging? We aren’t talking about spatial arrangement. So what are we talking about? Second, how can an arrangement of objects and properties be true or false? The set (Smith, the relation of punching, Jones) isn’t true or false? It doesn’t matter how much ordinal structure we introduce: the ordered triple <Smith, the relation of punching, Jones> is no more true or false than its counterpart. We will deal with these problems in due course. § The Tractarian Answer If I am reading him correctly, Wittgenstein gave a clear answer to the two questions we just asked. The sentence “Smith punches Jones” encodes an arrangement of objects and properties: Smith is related to Jones in some way, and the relation in question is of that of puncher to person punched. If reality comprises a state of affairs in which those things are arranged in that way, then the sentence is true. If not, it is false. Suppose this view is right. In that case, the proposition that Smith punches Jones consists of Smith, Jones, and the relation of punching being arranged in a certain way; and they are arranged in the very way in which they would be arranged in the corresponding state of affairs. The sentence is isomorphic with the proposition. The proposition is isomorphic with state of affairs. That is why the sentence represents the state of affairs. There is an obvious problem with this. If this view is right, then the thing meant by “Smith punches Jones” consists of Smith, Jones, and the relation of punching being arranged in the very way they are arranged in the corresponding state of affairs.

This obviously relates to the fact that analytically equivalent propositions can convey very different information and, what is a consequence, that analytic propositions do typically convey information. At the same time, the view just considered contains some profound truths, and our view will be more a development than a rejection of it. Another illustration may help. Again consider: (Ap) Smith punches Jones. In this world, if Jones and Smith are to exist, innumerable sub-atomic, atomic, chemical, molecular, cellular…events must occur. In any world where Jones and Smith exist, their existence supervenes on the existence of lowerlevel phenomena. The same is true of the relation of punching: if there is a punching, that supervenes on many other events. So no state of affairs that makes (Ap) true has have Smith or Jones or the relation of punching among its ultimate constituents. Given this, suppose we identify (Ap) with some property P such that (Ap) is true in w exactly if P is instantiated in w. In any world, an instance of P will make true many propositions whose ultimate constituents are not Smith or Jones – whose ultimate constituents are tiny displacements of mass-energy. This makes it hard to believe that P itself has a unique decomposition whose ultimate constituents are specifically Smith, Jones, and the relation of punching. If Jones manages to punch Smith, that is only by the grace of innumerable subvenient states of affairs. So P’s being instantiated demands the occurrence of subvenient states of affairs having certain properties. So it is individuative of P, and thus essential to it, that whenever it is instantiated, things more basic than Smith, Jones, and the relation of punching are instantiated. For this reason, it cannot be said with confidence that P has a unique, ultimate decomposition into Smith, Jones, and the relation of punching. On the contrary, it seems as though those three things are not among its ultimate constituents. This makes P unsuited for identification with (Ap). All of this assumes that properties themselves even have constituents. It is clear that instances of properties have constituents. An instance of the property chair has legs and a back.

We mustn’t be dismayed, however; for we must remember that Tommy cannot just be instantiated. An unpropertied Tommy – a Tommy who does nothing, feelings nothing, has no features – is a surd. What must be instantiated is a happy Tommy, an anxious Tommy or a smoking Tommy. Before we further discuss the legitimacy of these properties – whether they exist and whether we can use them if they do in fact exist – let’s look at the apparatus that we’ve been developing. Once again, let S be a set that contains [390] all and only A, B, and C; and remember that we have identified S with 1 (the proposition that Tommy is smoking). First of all, if C is instantiated, so are B and A. Further, if C, and therefore B, and A, are instantiated, then, and only then, is 1 true. It follows that 1 is true if, and only if, A, B, C are each instantiated. This suggest, though it may fall short of proving, that 1 is S that and that 1’s being true is S’s members’ being jointly instantiated. Here we come to some crucial points. It is true that 1 is true if, and only if, all of S’s members are instantiated. But there is another reason to identity 1 with S and 1’s truth with S’s members’ being instantiated. 1 and S have comparable decompositions. 1 has the following constituents. Tommy; smoking; Tommy’s smoking. S has the property of being identical with Tommy; the property of smoking; the property of being a smoking Tommy. (Actually, each of 1 and S has more constituents than this. We will deal with these remaining constituents in a moment; and when we examine them, we’ll see more evidence 1 and S stand in a sufficiently natural correspondence to each other that we are guilty of no artifice in identifying them.) If 1 is true, that entails that Tommy exists, that something smokes and, of course, that Tommy smokes. If S’s members are instantiated, those very same propositions hold. 1 and S have other...",

It is readily seen that, on our analysis, there is some x, such that x is Plato, such that 3 is true exactly if x snores, it being irrelevant what other properties x has. This is exactly what the direct-referentialist holds. At the same time, our analysis guarantees the existence of the proposition that Plato snores -after all, the property of being Plato exists, even though it is now uninstantiated. So our analysis of that Plato snores gives the direct-referencetheorist the truth-conditions that he wants and that (given certain compelling arguments due to Kripke 1980 and Soames 2003, 2004) he probably deserves. At the same time, our analysis doesn’t put the direct-referencetheorist in the awkward, logic-bending position of having to say that the proposition that Plato snores exists despite the failure of existence of entities on whose existence its own existence is constitutively necessary. III. Molecular propositions Our analysis applies to molecular propositions, no less than to atomic propositions. But making this transposition go through will involve a certain amount of sensitivity to details and technicalities. A certain amount of “engineering”, as opposed to philosophy “proper”, will be needed. Existence-claims: an introduction In keeping with tradition, I will treat generalizations as molecular propositions. So 4. something snores is an existential generalization. Given what we’ve said, the most obvious analysis of 4 would be to say that 4 is the property of snoring (or a set whose sole member is that property) and that 4’s being true is identical with that property’s being instantiated. That would not be the correct analysis. Even though 4 is true just in case the property of snoring is instantiated, 4 is not identical with that property and its truth is not identical with that property’s being instantiated. We know from Frege that 4, unlike the property of snoring, has a rather distinctive decompositional structure, and that 4 thus consists of (at least) three or four [394] constituents. We also know from Frege what the first two constituents are:",

So, from the viewpoint of truth-conditions, there is no barrier to identifying 4 with S or to identifying 4’s being true with S’s members’ being instantiated. Further, 4’s structure is easily mapped onto S’s. 4, if true, entails that there exists some property that has some instances; that there exists at least one snorer; that at least one property is instantiated; and that at least one property exists. And all of this is precisely what S’s members’ being instantiated involves. Now consider the proposition: 5 Something smokes. By reasoning similar to that just given, the constituents of this proposition are: a* the property of smoking b the property of being instantiated c.* the property of an instantiated function each of whose instances smokes. d. the property of an instantiated function each of whose instances has some property or other. We know pre-theoretically that 4 and 5 have certain constituents in common (e.g. the property of being instantiated or, in any case, some property expressed by “something”). Our analysis of 4 and 5 validate everything we know, theoretically and pre-theoretically, about the decompositions and logical forms of the propositions. Before considering “nothing snores”, I want to consider a negative, but non-quantified, proposition: 6. Timmy is not smoking, in other words, 6. It is not the case that Timmy is smoking. (The reason for the underlining will be clear in a moment.) Here we need to remember Conceit #7. The two immediate constituents of 6 would appear to be “It is not the case” and “that Timmy is smoking.” But there’s a problem here. We have said that propositions are sets of properties that are true when instantiated. In any case, this is what we have said about atomic propositions and, for uniformity’s sake, this is what we must say about molecular propositions. But if we say that, in 6, the underlined proposition is instantiated, i.e. that all its members are instantiated, then that Timmy is smoking will be true and 6 will be false and indeed self-negating.

Let us consider what happens when each of S’s members is instantiated. First, suppose that c is instantiated. In that case, there is an instance of a proposition that is false and that is identical with the proposition that Tommy is smoking. So 6 is true just in case c is instantiated. Since, if c is instantiated if the other members of S are instantiated, it follows that 6 is instantiated if, and only if, each of the members of S is instantiated. Thus, there are, as of yet, no bars to identifying 6 with S and 6’s truth with S’s members’ being instantiated. Next, suppose that b is instantiated. In that case, the property Tommy is smoking exists -- but it isn’t necessarily true. And if 6 should be true – which, according to our analysis, would mean that all of a-c were instantiated – we’d be stuck with the existence, but not the truth of the proposition that Tommy is smoking. Which is precisely what we want. Finally, suppose that a is instantiated. In that case, the property of being a false proposition is instantiated. And, of course, if 6 is true – if, in other words, the members of S are all instantiated – then that property is instantiated. Which, again, is precisely what we want. So our analysis most of our intuitions about the decomposition of 6 (the one exception that being that, where our pretheoretic intuition wants to that Tommy is smoking in 6, our analysis puts the property of being identical with that proposition in its place), and is inconsistent with the logical properties of that sentence. Let us now return to quantified propositions. Consider: 7. Everything snores. By reasoning similar to that already given, the main constituents of this are: a the property of snoring b the property of being universally instantiated c the property of being identical with a universally instantiated property that is identical with the property of snoring.

So if S is the set containing a-c, then 9 is true iff all of S’s members are instantiated. We’ve thus made it clear (i) what it is for something to be a “constituent” of a proposition”, (ii) what it is for an argument to “saturate” a function, (iii) more generally what it is for two propositional constituents to “synthesize” into a third constituent, (iv) what it is to be a proposition, and (v) what it is for a proposition to be true.

King (1996, 1997), to name but a few, a proposition is some kind of “structure” consisting of “objects and “properties.” So, according to this view, “Socrates is bald” is some kind of structure consisting of Socrates – the man himself, not some property that he has or some concept that he satisfies – and the property of baldness. Little if anything is said beyond that. It is usually said that the structure is not an unordered pair – that it is not (Socrates, baldness) – but has some kind of ordinal structure and is therefore <Socrates, baldness> or < the relation of having <Socrates, baldness>>, or some such. [396] Two questions arise. The ordered pair <2,7> isn’t true or false. Neither is the ordered pair <2,7 <less than>>. Given that these ordered pairs aren’t true or false, why is <Socrates, the relation of having <baldness>> true or false? There’s no denying that we could use this as a expressing the proposition now expressed by the sentence “Socrates is bald.” We could obviously invent a code whereby “<the relation of having <Socrates, baldness>>” meant Socrates is bald.

As we discussed, it certainly seems that, if one grasps the concepto knowledge, one also grasps the concepto true belief. This is exactly what Fodor denies. In his view, one could grasp the concepto knowledge without grasping any other conceptso. Fodor admits that there are some exceptions to this. A grasp of the concepto red cow is not an atom, as it plainly consists of a grasp of the concepto red and also the concepto cow. The same is true of the concepto prime number. If the concepto one is grasping is patently synthesized out of [407] other conceptso, then a grasp of it is not an atom. But with these exceptions, one’s grasp of a concepto is always an atom. Fodor’s denial of (i) is connected with his denial of (ii). Fodor thinks that conceptso (with the trivial exceptions just given) have no internal structure. The concepto knowledge has no constitutive connections to the conceptso belief or truth or justification. Of course, if Fodor is right about that, then we can see why a grasp of knowledge wouldn’t presuppose a grasp of these other conceptso. Fodor obviously admits that conceptso typically appear to have a great deal of analytic structure. Obviously knowledge is always true appears to be analytic; and so do 2 comes before 3 and causes precede their effects. He goes to great and ingenious lengths to explain away this appearance of [408] analyticity. We will consider these efforts soon enough. Fodor grants that there are some analytic truths. The concepto red cow is “patently phrasal”, as Fodor puts it. It is obviously built out of other conceptso (red and cow). Any such concepto will clearly be associated with various analytic truths. (x is a red cow implies, and is implied by, the conjunction x is red and x is a cow.) Fodor grants the existence of analyticities of that kind. And Fodor grants that x is a cow entails x is a cow. Notice that those analyticities are trivial. They don’t expose any hidden depths on the part of the relevant conceptso. In Fodor’s view, all analytic truths are in the same category as: (*) if x is a red cow, then x is a cow. We can be a...",

Here is the apparent problem for our analysis. The proposition: (AN) Necessarily, Hesperus is uniquely a last celestial body to disappear from the morning sky, is simply false, and nobody thinks otherwise. But what about (B)? At first glance, (B) looks like the kind of proposition that might be necessary. If that is the case, then our analysis is false. The truth is that our analysis does not put us on the wrong side of any modal facts. Let us consider the operator necessarily. This operator can combine in different ways with (B): more exactly, it can be given varying degrees of scope. (B1) Necessarily: something x is uniquely a last celestial body to disappear from the morning sky, and x is identical with a unique a last celestial body to disappear from the morning sky. (B2) Something x is uniquely a last celestial body to disappear from the morning sky, and necessarily: x is identical with a unique a last celestial body to disappear from the morning sky. (B1) and (B2) are simply false; and nobody would ever think otherwise. So in the relevant respects, they just like (AN). So our analysis does not turn true modal claims into false ones, or vice versa. Nonetheless, it might seem that our analysis has a peculiar consequence. We have said that you think of Hesperus through either (****) or through some other proposition of the same form. So it seems that, on our analysis, you must think of Hesperus a certain way: you must think of it as a last celestial body to disappear from the morning sky or a first celestial body to appear in the evening sky: in any case, you must think of it through some uniquely individuating description. But this seems wrong: for there doesn’t seem to be any that anyone has to think of Hesperus. For reasons we’ve seen, it seems that cognitively “locking onto” a thing O involves knowing some proposition of the form something x uniquely has phi, where O has phi.

Such a claim is false; there are many cads. Your picking up “Argo” involves your learning the truth of some claim: on some specific occasion, exactly one person x is being described as a cad, and “Argo” refers to x.

You have never heard the word “Socrates” before. You are talking with your friend Charlie; he says “Seymour is a latter day Socrates”. You don’t know who “Socrates” refers to? So you ask: “Who is Socrates?” Charlie says: “Socrates was the author of the Nichomachean Ethics and the Posterior Analytics”. Of course, Charlie is wrong; Socrates did not write either of those works; and “Socrates” does not refer to the author of either of those works. At the same time, in consequence of your having this exchange with Charlie, you can use the word “Socrates” to refer to Socrates. Here it seems as though you are able to refer to use the word “Socrates” to refer to Socrates, even though your only belief about him is wrong – even though the only thing you “know” about him isn’t true.

Therefore it would still be a true proposition that that triangles have three sides. If we try to say that truths and falsehoods come into existence with the onset of awareness, we must say that – even though there are no truths per se in a world devoid of mind – nonetheless such a world provides the grounds for truth. Though there were no truths a billion years, the grounds were still present for the truth that there were a certain number of planets. That is why, when a mind enters such a world, it finds itself surround by objective truths. But to say that the grounds for truth are present is just to say that the truths themselves are present. So I don’t see that the foregoing argument eliminates the existence of mind-independent truth. [2] Quine (1990: 26). [3] Richard Montague (1974) showed how to convert any sentence into one of subject-predicate form; arguably, he thus showed that any proposition is given by a sentence of that form. So the trouble with Kant’s definition isn’t exactly that it presupposes that all sentences (or propositions) are of that form. But after we use Montague’s method to convert (say) “if P, then P” into subject-predicate form, Kant’s definition of analyticity turns out to be false. After the conversion, that sentence becomes “if* <P, P>”, where “if* denotes a function assigning truth to an ordered pair of propositions exactly if the second proposition is a consequence of the first. So the subject becomes the ordered pair <P, P>, and the predicate becomes the second-level function denoted by “if*”. But this doesn’t help Kant. There is no sense, not even a metaphorical one, in which <P,P> is “contained” in the concept denoted by “if*”. [4] Strictly speaking, A=A is not a proposition. What is a proposition is for all a, A=A or Smith=Smith. When I talk about “A=A”, I mean some specific proposition of that form or the proposition that all propositions of that form are true.

In any case, it is clear that (a) and (b) should not be identified; for (a) says (essentially) that everything mental is representational, while (b) says only that the phenomenal is representational. [81][81] This objection was made to me by someone who read an earlier draft of this paper and who wishes to remain anonymous. If I am not mistaken, Gilbert Ryle advocates this conception of memory. Also, it seems to me that those who deny the existence of unconscious mental activity, e.g. John Searle, are compelled to advocate this conception of memory. I think that many functionalists would adopt the view advocated by the objector. [82] See Heck [1] for an excellent discussion of this issue.

But this is not the general practice. Usually, what I am calling “propositional” content is referred to as “conceptual” content, and I what I am call “non-propositional” content is referred to as “non-conceptual” content.

This is because propositions can have things other than concepts as constituents, and therefore can have something that deserves to be call “non-conceptual” content. In any case, this is almost universally held these days. The idea is that the proposition Socrates is bald is de re about Socrates, and thus has Socrates himself – who is obviously not a concept – as a constituent. If Socrates himself can be a constituent of propositions, then some of the content of some propositions is something other than a concept, and is thus non-conceptual. In general, if propositions can have things other than concepts as their constituents – and it is practically universally agreed that they can – then propositions can have things other than concepts for their constituents and thus have something that might legitimately called “non-conceptual” content.

By itself, this is not a problem for CTM. CTM can say: Thought consist in syntax-driven operations; but those operations involves symbols of what we might call a “well-behaved” language – the kind that Frege and Russell talked about: a language in which there is a kind of coincidence between logical and syntactical form. In English “Bill is a decoy duck” has the same syntax as “Bill is a green duck.” But “Bill is a green duck” means: “Bill is a duck and Bill is green”, whereas “Bill is a decoy duck” does not mean “Bill is a decoy and Bill is a duck”. If thinking consists in syntax-driven operations, the medium of computation is a language in which doesn’t contain distortion like “Bill is a decoy duck” – everything is made perspicuous. This is a reasonable response; but it leaves some important issues untouched. No speaker of English would regard (b) as a legitimate inference. Why not? Because anyone who knows the meaning of (b) knows that it is not equivalent to: “Bill is a duck and Bill is a decoy, therefore Bill is a duck”. A knowledge of meaning is what prevents faux-inferences like (b). But a knowledge of meaning is always involved in determinations of syntactic structure, even in cases of the idealized languages referenced by Russell and Frege. Suppose we spoke a language like English except that, in this other language, syntactical form mirrored logical form. Let English* be this other language. The English*-translation of “Bill is a green duck” is “Bill is green and Bill is a duck”. The English*-translation of “Bill is a decoy duck” is not “Bill is a decoy and Bill is a duck”; it is (roughly) “Bill is an object that looks like a duck, but is not a duck”. So English* doesn’t contain the devices that, in English, make syntax diverge from logical form.

This is certainly one way to look at things. There is another possibility. It is a distinct possibility that “decoy duck” and “green duck” are syntactically different. As we saw, the syntactic profile of a sentence is a function of the more generic facts about the semantics of its constituents: it is a function, not of what specific things its constituents mean, but of the kinds of thing they mean. “Jerry snores and Mary does not snore” has a certain syntactic structure; it has it because “Jerry” is a singular term, “snores” is a first-order one-place predicate, “and” is a certain kind of functor, and so forth. Given this, consider:",

It is a second-level predicate, one that (arguably) denotes a second-level function. “Tall” (if Frege is right) denotes a function from individuals to truth-values: so it denotes a first order function. “Something” denotes a function from first order functions (functions from individuals to truth-values) to truth-values. Supposing that the Frege-Montague analysis is even remotely right, “something” denotes a function F that assigns truth to a first-order function f exactly if, for some x, f assigns truth to x. “Something” and “Bob” denote such different things that they are plausibly seen as falling into different syntactic categories; so (A) and (B) are plausibly seen as being syntactically different. Of course, (A) and (B) are grammatically parallel. But, as Chomsky pointed out long ago, grammatical categories make for very superficial taxonomy. Grammar is folk-syntax; grammatical descriptions are shallow and, at best, approximate, syntactic descriptions. (When I talk about “grammar”, I am referring to the taxonomic system that we are taught in school: the system that includes categories like “noun”, “adjective”, “determiner”, “conjunction”, and that regards “a man” and “Socrates” as both being “noun phrases” and thus in the same syntactic category. So when I talk about “grammar”, I am not using the term that it bears in expressions like “generative grammar”, “universal grammar”, or in any of the theories that aspire to replace the taxonomy we learn in school with a deeper characterization of language.) It is a possibility worth considering that “decoy” and “green”, like “Bob” and “something”, denote entirely different kinds of things. If this is right, then",

For (C) to be true, it is necessary that Bill fall into a sub-class of the class of ducks. So the term “green” can be seen as a function that maps a predicate (in this case “duck”) onto a restriction of itself. But the term “decoy” does not function in this way at all. For (D) to be true, Bill must fall outside the class of ducks. So “decoy” does not denote a function from predicates onto restrictions of themselves. It has for its meaning an entirely different sort of function. Given that “decoy” and “duck” denote such different things, it is not out of the question that they might be syntactically very different. Remember that the syntax of an expression consists in very generic facts about its semantics. Where “decoy” and “green” are concerned, those generic facts might be sufficiently different to warrant putting those expressions in different syntactic categories. If that is right – I am not saying that it is, but I am saying that it is a possibility worth looking into -- then the syntax of (C) is entirely different from the syntax of (D).

    "text": "* “Bill is a decoy duck, therefore Bill is a duck.” is reflected in a difference in syntax. So the fact that (a) is valid, while (b) is not, does not necessarily reflect a failure for English semantic categories to line up with English syntactic categories. We are quick to see English, and other natural languages, as badly behaved. We take the invalidity of inferences like (b), and like “Bill is a small elephant, therefore Bill is small”, to indicate that English lacks a certain transparency – that it is, in some respect, “badly behaved”. What I am suggesting is that, arguably (though not definitely), those cases of bad behavior are merely apparent. When we look at the syntax of the expressions involved, we find that English is no less well-behaved than English* or any formal language. Syntactic facts are so deeply embedded in semantics facts that there no hope of a syntax-driven entity that isn’t also semantics-driven. I am suggesting that, in English, semantic and syntactic categories quite possibly do line up as well as they do in formal languages. The view that they do not is based on a confusion of grammar (in the sense of what we learn in middle school, not in the sense of “generative grammar”, “transformational grammar” and the like), which is a superficial theory about syntax, with syntax itself. Because of sentences like (b), it is obvious that there is no way for a semantics-blind entity to track logical relations among English sentences. So if English is wellbehaved, as I am suggesting it might be, then it is obvious that a semantic-blind entity cannot track logical relations holding among sentences of a well-behaved language. Semantic knowledge will always be involved. A different example might clarify my point. Traditional grammar sees the following two sentences as having the same form: (A) “John touches a boat.” (B) “John wants a boat”. But there is every reason to believe that “wants” and “touches” are syntactically very different: the first takes a sentence (or open sentence) for its complement; the latter takes a subsentential expression. Permit to explain my meaning. (A) is famously ambiguous between de dicto and de re readings (Quine 1966). The de dicto reading is: John wants that there is some boat x such that John has x. According to Quine (1966), the de re reading is: There is some boat x such that:...",

    "text": "* “O incurred the wrath of his less talented contemporaries.” Remember what we said earlier about “Julius” and “Newman I”. Unless one knows which individuals these terms refer to, one doesn’t know which propositions are encoded in “Julius was tall” and “Newman 1 will be a genius”; one has a simulated, but not an actual, understanding of what is meant by such sentences. One has knowledge of a description of the proposition that is encoded in such a sentence, but one doesn’t know which proposition is thus described. One knows that “Julius was tall” is true exactly if somebody x uniquely invented the zipper and x was tall. So it is clear that knowing who so and so is, and thus knowing the literal meanings of terms that refer to so and so, does not consist (merely) in knowing some uniquely individuating description that applies to so and so. What else is needed? The short, very approximate answer is: To identify is to re-identify. To know who so and so is, one must know of two existence-claims that are uniquely verified by so and so and, further, one must know that some one person uniquely verifies them. Suppose you meet Bob on Monday. Since you have just met him, there is a sense in which you don’t know who he is. If somebody asks you, “do you know who this is?”, you must say: “I am afraid I do not.” But, of course, in meeting him, you are uploading information that enables you to think about him – you are acquiring a concept of him. As we saw, this information is existential. Suppose that, a day later, you see Bob again. This time, there is a sense in which you know who you are seeing. As we saw earlier, your recognizing Bob consists in your knowing two existence claims of which he is the sole verifier, and also in your knowing that he uniquely verifies those propositions. That is the short answer to the question “what is it to know who somebody (or something) is?”. Here is the long answer. Identification is a contextual notion; it is always relative to some background question, or relative to some body of knowledge, that one knows, or fails to know, who somebody is.

Under ordinary circumstances, if we know that something is a piano, we almost certainly already know that it isn’t a raven. But imagine the following. You have bet your friend Smith $1,000,000 that all ravens are black. There is some object x such that, although you and Smith don’t yet know it, x is a piano. All you know about x is that it’s pink. In that case, when you discover that x is a piano, and thus a non-raven, you (but not Smith) will breathe a sigh of relief; and your confidence in (1) will surge, and so, of course, will your confidence in (2). Now imagine a different scenario. You have bet your friend Smith $1,000,000 that all non-black things are non-ravens. There is some object y such that, although you and Smith don’t yet know it, y is black. All you know about y is that it’s a raven. When you discover that y is black, you will breathe a sigh of relief; and your confidence in (2) will surge, and so, of course, will your confidence in (1). Thus, to Hempel, the confirmational disparities between (1) and (2) are illusory. When we imagine ourselves trying to confirm (2), we assume that we are looking at things that we already know to be non-ravens, but we don’t make the same assumption mutatis mutandis when we imagine ourselves to be trying to confirm (1). Hempel’s solution is better than Quine’s, but it’s still no good. The problem is that, if it’s known that there is no nomic or causal relationship between a thing’s being a raven, on the one hand, and its being black, on the other, then there is ipso facto no reason to believe that the next raven you see will be black. Maybe you’ve seen a million ravens, all of them black. It’s doesn’t matter. Unless you have reason to believe that a thing’s being a raven is connected somehow to its being black, you’re guilty of the gambler’s fallacy if, on the basis of that data, you believe that the next raven you see is (likely to be) black. But if you do believe that a thing’s being a raven is connected in some way to its being black, then your confidence in (1) is derivative...",

    "text": "* there are continuous functions that cannot be differentiated at any point. It’s only in a thoroughly sterile, strictly model-theoretic sense that (i) entails (iv). The way in which (i) entails (ii) isn’t so antiseptic, and neither is the way in which it entails (iii). But, it seems to me, the way in which (ii) follows from (i) is more transparent than the way in which (iii) does so; and a viable theory of propositions ought to validate that point. In my book__, and my paper__, I argue that, whereas first entailment holds in virtue of the structures of the immediate constitutents of the propositions involved, the second entailment holds in virtue of structures of those constituents---it holds in virtue of, as it were, the constituencies of those propositions’ constituencies. Moving onto another point: It is, I believe, sentence-tokens, never sentence-types, that are true or false. My reasons for this, which I state at length in my book__, are extensions of arguments put forth by Strawson (1950), Barwise and Perry (1983), and Kaplan (1989). Long story short: It’s incontrovertible that no sentence-type containing a context-sensitive parameter is true or false. Consider the sentence-type “that guy is a threat to our way of life.” Some instances of that sentence-type are true or false, but the sentence-type per se is neither. All sentences of natural language contain contextsensitive component. In some cases, e.g. “there are infinitely prime numbers,” that component (in this case, the present-tense marker) aren’t doing any work. But that has to do with the non-semantic fact that mathematical reality doesn’t change. If, as Mill and other hyper-empiricists hold, it does change, then whether “there are infinitely primes” is true or false is a function of the time (and possibly the place) of utterance. Sentence-tokens are spatiotemporal objects. Sentence-types, being things of which there are instances, are properties and therefore aren’t spatiotemporal objects. So, where natural language is concerned, it is always spatiotemporal entities that have truth-values. Of course, there could exist, and presumably do exist, context-insensitive languages (cf. the artificial language, or languageextension, to which “1+2=3” belongs). But this would not be a good move. No difference is greater than that between the spatiotemporal and the Platonic. Given this fact, along with the fact that the term “truth-evaluable expression” corresponds to an explanatorily fecund category, it’s hard to see how that class could contain both expression-tokens and expression-types.

Any instance of c is an instance of (b) the property of being identical with the property (which is not the same as being an instance of snoring) and is also an instance of (a) the property of being universally uninstantiated. So if c is instantiated, so are b and a. Thus, if c is instantiated, then there is an instance of the property of being identical with a universally uninstantiated property of snoring. In other words, there exists a universally uninstantiated property and that property is identical with the property of snoring. Since c cannot be instantiated without a and b being instantiated, that means that if a-c are instantiated, then there exists a universally uninstantiated property, that property being the property of snoring. And that, of course, is equivalent (if it isn’t outright said) by “nothing snores.” [396] I know that this point was made by John Perry, but I have forgotten where he says it and haven’t been able to find this out. [397] Different people have different views as to what that property. My (Kripke-influenced) guess is that it is the property of developing into something with certain biological and, hopefully, psychologically characteristics out of a certain gamete. But whatever that property is, it exists even when Joey doesn’t, i.e. even when it isn’t instantiated. [398] It was Donald Smith who brought it to my attention that my analysis avoids this pitfall of direct reference theory. I am sympathetic to many aspects of direct reference theory. I think that there is some x such that, if true, the sentence “Socrates is bald” is true exactly if the same is true of the singular proposition x is bald. So I hold that, for that sentence to be true, it is necessary that Socrates – not the great hemlock-drinking philosophers and not the sarcastic main protagonist in most of Plato’s dialogues – be bald. Basically, I was, and am, a card-carrying direct-reference theorist. But, independently of that, I held the view, described in this paper, about propositions. It was not until talking with Donald, some weeks ago, that I could use theory of propositions to produce a form of direct-reference theory wouldn’t be stuck with the embarrassing (because so implausible)...",
