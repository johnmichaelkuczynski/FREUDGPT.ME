Intuition, for Kant, is a para-perceptual process that reveals how we *must* perceive the world, not how the world *is*. This leads to a psychologization of necessity and undermines the objective validity of a priori knowledge. - **Kant’s transcendental arguments can be salvaged** by reinterpreting them in logical rather than psychological terms. Where Kant speaks of *synthetic a priori* truths, we should speak of *hard analytic* truths—conceptually necessary but non-obvious propositions."

This view is both empirically and conceptually untenable. - **Reality is analogue, not digital.** Spatiotemporal events are continuous and causally interconnected. Descriptions of events as discrete are *models* of reality, not reality itself. - **Hume’s puzzle of induction** arises from conflating *propositional data* (e.g., “all observed swans are white”) with the *non-propositional, perceptual data* that actually grounds our inductive practices. The latter is continuous and causally structured, providing a logical (analogue-logical) basis for induction. - **Causation is inherent in continuity.** Temporal and spatial relations are themselves causal notions. There is no such thing as a non-causal description of a spatiotemporal event."

Counter-inductive hypotheses are not merely improbable but *analogue-logically invalid* because they imply discontinuities incompatible with the causal structure of reality. - **Explanation is not mere subsumption under regularities** (as Hume and Hempel thought), but the uncovering of *principled, causal connections* that are logically entailed by the structure of reality."

What matters financially is enrollment rates, not retention rates. Low retention rates do not necessarily indicate institutional failure—they may indicate the institution serves students on the cusp of being able to complete degrees.

Most of a university's business depends on providing instruction that is on average lackluster. Most students are just buying a degree; only a few are really working for it. The degree has prestige because of the efforts of those few. The ideal situation for a university is when its degrees have prestige and as few people as possible are responsible for giving them that prestige. Setting aside ~15% of students who major in engineering, nursing, etc., students don't want particularly high-quality instruction. High-quality instruction is demanding; since students are paying for degrees, they want minimal hoops. Students do want to believe their degrees have meaning—they're willing to jump through some hoops. If universities made instruction more demanding, they would attract more savants, truth-seekers, and aspiring doctors/engineers—but for each such student gained, they'd lose ten existing customers."

If someone useless has stable employment, their employment isn't contingent on being useful. Nobody expects redundant bureaucrats and middle managers to be useful—that's not why they're employed. Jobs serving well-defined practical functions are easily lost; jobs with ill-defined functions are secure. If one is employed only because useful, earnings wax and wane with degree of usefulness. People who make their living by being useful tend not to have inflated salaries. People with ill-defined functions may have enormously inflated salaries. Most college graduates end up as well-paid pencil-pushers in corporations or government agencies—well-paid for doing little more than showing up and not making waves. Political science majors know their major doesn't make them useful—that's part of why they do it. A \"successful\" political science major tends to end up with a well-paying job without well-defined functions—therefore relatively secure.

Unlike OMCs, universities actually depend on poor internal communications. University departments are highly isolated and fiercely independent—cooperation happens rarely, at specific junctures, in circumscribed ways, after lengthy negotiations. An OMC would fail if its departments were comparably isolated. OMCs are about providing optimal products/services; universities are about maintaining prestige. Prestige is harder to maintain when information flows freely than when sequestered. If departments cooperated whenever students would benefit, professors would face scrutiny from students not under their thumb—they'd have to step up their game considerably. The kind of professor who would thrive under cross-departmental scrutiny is high-energy and demanding—most students prefer professors of the second kind (comfortable in their niche, demanding little).

When an organization sells results, prices tend to drop; when it sells services, prices tend to rise. When results are sold, there's no money in services and services must be streamlined. When services are sold, there's no money in results and services must be inflated. Results-providers compete on efficiency; prices bid down. Service-providers compete on inefficiency; prices bid up. Service organizations depend on poor KM—they make money by multiplying and drawing out services. Management in service organizations profits from inefficiencies that good communication eliminates. Internal communications tend to be bad when employment is guaranteed and good when it isn't. Internal communications tend to be good when salaries are performance-dependent and bad when they aren't. It's hard to know who's pulling their weight unless clients hire employees directly. When clients cannot hire talent directly, projects go to the wrong people; talent is misdeployed and underdeployed. Organization-internal communications are worthless unless based on solid information about how to engage the market.

Because individual classes have either no significance or no determinate significance, accreditations can only be awarded for hulkingly large pluralities of classes. This is a hedging strategy—Smith must have some merit if he passes 100 classes, even if many had no meaning. The less guarantee a class has merit, the larger the number of classes needed for a degree taken as proof of merit. This limits the number of degree levels a university can issue. If individual courses had guaranteed and determinate meanings, passing even a single class would be definite proof of a definite kind of merit. At DMO, there's no such thing as a grade that isn't definitive proof of well-defined merit. Therefore, a DMO student can prove high, definite merit by passing relatively few classes. Therefore, DMO can credibly issue many different levels of degrees. Any given course at DMO is itself a mini-degree. Students can earn credible degrees from DMO in a fraction of the time and expense of conventional institutions.
